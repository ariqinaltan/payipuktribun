She went makeup-free on <a href=#>Instagram</a> back in 2017 when she snapped a bed selfie with a 102 fever, proving that even when she's not feeling her best, she's still looking her best. The star even joked that feeling hot had given her the "perfect" blush shade on her cheeks. Gorgeous!</p><p>We know the star knows all about the best makeup shades too, as she actually likes to do her own makeup despite having access to some of the best makeup artists in the world. The star is good friends with makeup mogul Charlotte Tilbury and chatted all things beauty with her during a 2020 <a href=#>Instagram Live</a> stream, where Vergara admitted she used to do her own makeup while filming "Modern Family." "It was like therapy. I would go there at 5 am, start my makeup, I'd do it faster than anybody, and it was really fun," she shared.</p><p>Vergara also revealed she pretty much always has a little makeup on, and getting a little glam helped made her feel better while at home during the coronavirus pandemic. "I realized it's getting me depressed. I have to start my normal thing of waking up, showering, and I feel better, start working, do things from home. I needed makeup just for myself and to not feel like I am sick," she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcW9haH13e8eeqZ6rXay1osCMrKafoZFiw6a%2BxpqpmmWcpLysv4yloKSdXay2tbTOrqtmpZGgsra8jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

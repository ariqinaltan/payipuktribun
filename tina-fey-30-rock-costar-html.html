The movie follows Hamm as a small-town detective investigating the murders of two women with the same name. <a href=#>Deadline</a> reports that Screen Media has recently purchased the film for distribution in North America and plans to release it to theaters in June.</p><p>Maggie Moore(s) is the first time Tina Fey and Jon Hamm have worked together since the <a href=#>Mad Men star’s</a> seven-episode stint on 30 Rock. Hamm played Dr. Drew Baird, Fey’s handsome but dumb-as-a-bag-of-rocks love interest. The two actors had undeniable chemistry on screen, and watching them play off each other once more is sure to be fun.</p><p>Maggie Moore(s) also serves as a Mad Men reunion. John Slattery, who played Roger Sterling for seven seasons on the AMC drama, directs the film from a script by Paul Bernbaum. Sterling was the sometimes mentor/sometimes frenemy to Jon Hamm’s Don Draper over the entire run of the series. The film also stars Ted Lasso’s Nick Mohammed and Mindhunter actor Happy Anderson.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/jon-hamm-confess-fletch-900x506.jpg><p>Maggie Moore(s) will be Tina Fey’s first big-screen live-action outing since 2019’s Wine Country. <a href=#>The actress</a> provided a voice for the 2020 Pixar animated film Soul but has stuck to television for the most part, these last few years. Jon Hamm starred in last year’s <a href=#>Confess Fletch</a>, a mid-budget comedy that failed to do anything spectacular at the box office. If Maggie Moore(s) performs well, it could be just the comeback both stars need to jumpstart their lagging film careers.</p><p>If John Slattery’s hype for the upcoming movie is any indication, it could very well be the hit Hamm and Fey need. “I’m so proud of Maggie Moore(s) and the entire cast and filmmaking team,” the Avengers: End Game star said enthusiastically. Slattery also said the script had the “potential for a unique story to be told” and praised the film for capturing “a lot of today’s true-crime, stranger-than-fiction culture.”</p><p>Screen Media also praised the film, calling it a “true crime-inspired ride that will keep audiences guessing until the end.” True Crime is a very popular genre at the moment between series like Netflix’s Dahmer and hit podcasts like Serial. It’s no surprise that Jon Hamm and Tina Fey would want to be a part of a project inspired by such a hot trend.</p><p>It’s not known yet what kind of relationship Hamm and Fey’s characters will have. The obvious choice based on their previous<a href=#> collaboration</a> would be lovers, but they could just as easily be playing adversaries. Both actors have proven to be adept at playing jerks (Hamm’s Bridesmaids character) and characters that endear themself with the audience (Fey’s beleaguered teacher in Mean Girls).</p><p>Whatever the roles, when you have talent at the level of Jon Hamm and Tina Fey, you are likely to get a great performance no matter what. Add John Slattery to the mix, and Maggie Moore(s) looks more like the sleeper hit of 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ismaOubrLEsmRsaF2nvKS3jJymrKyRp3upwMyl</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

One of my favorites, the ever so fabulous @ bitchbewithyou, posted a recent salute to the Mushroom cut, or, as some know it, the butt cut."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

(Ew.) As I scrolled through the collection of period&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/g33895300/celebrity-heartthrobs-then-and-now/>heartthrobs</a>—Leo DiCaprio in&nbsp;Romeo + Juliet&nbsp;(1996), Will Friedle in&nbsp;Boy Meets World—I couldn't help but wonder,&nbsp;Why not bring this back?</p><p>I know what you're thinking:&nbsp;Bianca. Please. No.&nbsp;My friends expressed the same sentiment when I sent the post to my group chat, pleading for someone else to join #TeamMushroom. Most of them didn't even know what it was, which was 1) rude and 2) a sign they required a history lesson in hair.</p><p>The once-omnipresent trend was a style worn by It boys and men of the '90s and early '00s that basically involved parting their longish hair down the middle so the front strands fell forward, creating a curtain effect around the face and giving one's forehead time to shine. It's like a bowl cut...if it was given an Instagram aesthetic.</p><p>Greasy hair without a part? Gross. But parted down the middle? Chic. Haven't seen your hairstylists in some time? Not a problem with this look. The point is: It's the perfect hairstyle for a post-COVID world, allowing locks that are overdue for a trim to flow freely. But if you're looking at it now wondering,&nbsp;Why was I in love with a man whose hair resembled produce?&nbsp;That's a great question!</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.racked.com/2017/9/8/16270082/90s-boy-hair referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Some psychiatrists have said</a>&nbsp;affection for this 'do goes back to our Disney-watching days, when it seemed like every hero—e.g. John Smith in&nbsp;Pocahontas—sported the elongated style. At the time, it was seen as the perfect balance between masculine and feminine. And because young women everywhere went gaga over these animated dudes, Hollywood producers theorized that those same lovey-dovey feelings would translate to three dimensions. Shocker: They did.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TjHE9dFytkR5toJSKgFRYM-1920-80.jpg><p>Others&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://news.avclub.com/a-detailed-history-of-90s-butt-cuts-unearths-links-to-d-1833152874 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>posit</a>&nbsp;the look was popular because it also showed off the thickness of a man's hair, which suggested he was very much fertile and would be a great partner. This is great to know, but I can 100 percent promise you the last thing I was thinking about at age 7 was whether or not I could have children with Prince Eric from&nbsp;The Little Mermaid. I wanted to be a mermaid, not married with children.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

It's precisely the kind of serotonin boost I, and many fans of the look, need to finish out this year with a bang. Ha, get it? ...Because it has bangs. Anyway, stop what you're doing. Reach out to all your male-identifying friends and tell them to reach for the scissors and get snipping. With how this year went, we need a silver lining, and that just might be in the shape of a mushroom.</p><p>And if they still need convincing as to why this is arguably the best haircut ever, take them through the Mushroom Haircut Hall of Fame, where Hollywood heartthrobs of years past don the style with grace (and a little bit of grease.)</p><h2 id=the-unofficial-mushroom-haircut-hall-of-fame-3>The Unofficial Mushroom Haircut Hall of Fame</h2><p>Image 1 of 9</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg><h4 class=item__title>James Van Der Beek in 'Dawson's Creek'</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h4 class=item__title>Hugh Grant circa 1994</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h4 class=item__title>Brad Pitt circa 1992</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h4 class=item__title>John Stamos in 'Full House'</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h4 class=item__title>Nick Carter circa 1996</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h4 class=item__title>Rider Strong in 'Boy Meets World'</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h4 class=item__title>David Beckham circa 1996</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h4 class=item__title>Leonardo DiCaprio circa 1995</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h4 class=item__title>Brendan Fraser circa 1999</h4><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJulocG2vsRomGxsZ2aDeH6SaKSuq5invLC5jJusraxdmMK1eZhpqmagkZ6%2FpMHTaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

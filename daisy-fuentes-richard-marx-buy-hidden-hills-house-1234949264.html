Simultaneously, they’ve sold an ocean-view Malibu mansion for $6.1 million, comfortably above the $5 million Marx&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>paid for the place</a>&nbsp;in 2015.</p><p>Though Fuentes and Marx are perhaps not as widely known today as they were during their early professional years, they’re clearly no less successful. Cuban-born Fuentes, 54, was a pioneer of the celebrity licensing/branding deals that are today an integral part of many artists’ income streams; by 2013, her namesake apparel brand had&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>racked up a whopping $1.5 billion</a>&nbsp;in lifetime sales. And Marx, 57, still reaps huge royalty paychecks from songs he’s written for other artists, in addition to his own hits — which still regularly stream on soft rock radio stations across the country, 20+ years after their debut.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>Built in 1973 but extensively renovated and expanded in 2019, the couple’s new Hidden Hills mansion spans nearly 9,000 square feet of luxury living space, with six bedrooms and six full bathrooms. The place is also endlessly peaceful, tucked away at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac atop a steep ridgeline, with panoramic views framing the surrounding hills and otherwise pancake-flat San Fernando Valley skyline. A sizable infinity swimming pool adds to the visual glitz.</p><p>Described in the listing as a “stunning contemporary estate,” the house is of unclear architectural provenance but will no doubt impress guests. An all-glass entryway spills into a double-height foyer; a step-down living room boasts a fireplace and foldaway doors with spectacular views.</p><p>Wide-plank oak floors continue into the open dining room and the massive kitchen, which includes chic finished and commercial-grade appliances. Also on the ground floor are an oversized pantry/prep room and a family room that spills out to the grassy backyard via more foldaway glass doors.</p><p>The home’s six en suite bedrooms include an upstairs master with its own cozy sitting room, plus a private balcony and lavish bathroom.</p><p>Back downstairs, the sprawling — roughly two-acre — lot includes a gated motorcourt anchoring an attached four-car garage, plus spacious loggias, numerous patios, and the aforementioned pool/spa overlooking Hidden Hills and surrounding communities.</p><p>In case Fuentes and Marx ever need to borrow a pesky cup of sugar, some of their new neighbors include Lil Wayne, Madonna, Drake, Jeffree Star, John Stamos and multiple members of the Kardashian clan.</p><p>The couple also own at least two other luxury homes, one of them a $5.8 million oceanfront pad in Malibu that was acquired solely by Fuentes in 2013, prior to their marriage. And in 2019, the pair jointly purchased a $3.1 million getaway in Florida’s pricey Coral Gables community, just outside of Miami.</p><p>As for the couple’s other Malibu home, the one just sold for $6.1 million last month — that property included a Mediterranean-style mansion (below) with five bedrooms in approximately 6,000 square feet of living space. The new owners, tech industry executive Tom Kershaw and his Ukrainian-born wife Yelena, will enjoy the property’s close proximity to gorgeous Paradise Cove beach — plus luxe amenities like a wine cellar, recording studio and separate guesthouse.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Marc Shevin</a>&nbsp;of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices California Properties and&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>John Galich</a>&nbsp;of Sotheby’s International Realty held the Hidden Hills listing;&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Leah Lail</a>&nbsp;of Coldwell Banker repped Fuentes and Marx.&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Lynette Bishop</a>&nbsp;of Compass and&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Rita Simpson</a>&nbsp;of Sotheby’s International Realty held the Malibu listing;&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Britney Smits</a>&nbsp;of Coldwell Banker repped the buyers.</p><p>This story first appeared on&nbsp;Dirt.com.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8uinZ6rpK65pnvRnpilZZWowaLAxGibmqGjrnqnwcSnq56rXae2pLTAq5tmpZGnxW6u1LJkoaGUmbKveceio6WrXZ28tr%2FEZmhra2RugXp%2BlW1m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

While T.I. may not have as many years in the rap game as Nas, he might not have as many #1’s as Jay-z, and he might not have as many successful proteges as <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Dr. Dre</a>, TIP is basically the self-appointed Yoda of rap. His uncanny wisdom is often well-spoken and contemplative. T.I.’s knowledge comes from both experience and observation. His street smarts, coupled with his tenure as a CEO, has given him perspective from both the ground floor and the rooftop suite.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Throughout the years, T.I. has delivered eloquently articulated jewels of knowledge to both his peers and his companions.

You don't do that, you know what I'm saying? Our secrets are sacred. We don't do that. That's a whole level of fuck boy shit.

After Iggy’s mixtape Ignorant Art launched her into the stratosphere, T.I. signed the young goddess to his Grand Hustle imprint. Since then, Iggy has beefed with other female artists such as Azealia Banks, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kreayshawn</a> and Halsey. Using Twitter as her means of venting, Iggy has stumbled into feud after feud on the social media site.

Since Nelly’s arrest, the victim&nbsp;has asked to drop the case, and&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">refused to testify</a>. The rape/assault money grab has been a Hollywood hustle for ladies looking to making a few quick M's off celebrities for decades. While actual instances of sexual assault and rape are vile and horrendous, false rape accusations should be deemed just as dangerous. After hearing of Nelly’s predicament, T.I. took to his Instagram to voice his opinion on false rape accusations.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“If more than twelve find&nbsp;us&nbsp;guilty, we got to answer to that.

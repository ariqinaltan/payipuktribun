The former is both <a href=# rel>directing and starring</a> in the film alongside his friend, meaning they've been spending plenty of time on the press circuit together. Unfortunately for both actors, they've been facing unflattering comments about them in the news, specifically about <a href=# rel>being "corny."</a></p><p>During the red carpet premiere of his directorial debut, Jordan took a moment to chat with <a href=# rel>Lore'l from The Morning Hustle</a>. The pair formerly went to middle school together, and during a past episode, the media personality and her co-host discussed this point in her life. At the time, a quip was made about the Black Panther star being "corny," which he obviously took to heart as he <a href=# rel>brought them up to Lore'l </a>during their interview.</p><span><h2 id=h-creed-is-here>Creed is Here</h2></span><p>She's since confirmed that she wasn't the one to describe the California native using that phrase. She also compared him publicly (and incorrectly) calling her out to <a href=# rel>Will Smith slapping Chris Rock</a> at the 2022 Oscars. Jordan on the other hand seems to have happily moved on with his life, sitting down for much more pleasant conversations with Majors and other journalists.</p><p>While chatting with Pay Or Wait personality, Sharronda Williams, the costars candidly spoke about their excitement surrounding Creed III. Movie lovers were happy to hear more about the film, but some super sleuths couldn't help but notice that the cameras obviously caught both Jordan and Majors checking out the interviewer's behind as she walked away from their chairs. In the hours since, the clip has been going viral, earning hundreds of hilarious reactions online.</p><span><h2>Twitter Reacts to Jordan and Majors' Wandering Eyes</h2></span><p>Jonathan Majors and Michael B.

Jonathan turned his whole damn head!" one user joked, calling out the 33-year-old for nearly breaking his neck over Williams. "They Beating The White Women Allegations," someone else wrote, referring to past speculation about Jordan's preference for fair-skinned women.

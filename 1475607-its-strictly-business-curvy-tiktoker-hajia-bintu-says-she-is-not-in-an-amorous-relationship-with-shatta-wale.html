People comment saying; Shatta Wale has already gotten intimate with her, Shatta Wale's ex. it's not true. Shatta Wale and I's relationship was strictly business.<p class=align-left>She noted that she has not responded to critics all this while because they are not her mother.

But it was Shatta Wale who pushed me to hit the international market. People know me because of Shatta Wale, because of Hajia Bintu, the track.

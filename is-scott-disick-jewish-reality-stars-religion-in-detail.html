The ex-Kardashian boyfriend has shown glimpses of his faith on the show and on social media, so here’s what we know about it.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/03/GettyImages-1144019158-731x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-is-scott-disick-jewish>Is Scott Disick Jewish?</h2><p>Yes, the 39-year-old was raised in a Jewish household by his late parents, Bonnie and Jeffrey. The couple passed away within three months of each other in late 2013 and early 2014.</p><p>It’s unknown whether the Talentless founder regularly prays and attends services in 2023, during a 2012 episode of Kourtney And Kim Take Miami, Disick admitted that he had been out of touch with his Jewish roots for years.</p><p>E! filmed his attempts to reconnect with the religion by attending a synagogue service, during which he felt “uncomfortable” since he could not read or speak Hebrew.</p><p>“I don’t really know what prayer we’re on,” he said in a confessional, “but being in a temple feels great.”</p><p>Kourtney, however, wasn’t as on board with Scott’s efforts, claiming that it was a “phase” in his life, which he labeled as “disrespectful”.</p><p>“There is no way Scott is going to risk messing up his hair in wearing this yarmulke,” she predicted. A yarmulke is a small brimless cap usually worn by Jewish males.</p><p>The reality star celebrated Hanukkah with Mason, Penelope, and Reign in 2021, and visited Israel the year before, where he was blessed by a rabbi in Jerusalem. He wore a yarmulke, so he proved Kourtney wrong.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><a title=@hamsaclubtv href=#>@hamsaclubtv</a><p>Replying to @aushantel <a title=scottdisick href=#>#scottdisick</a> <a title=kimkardashian href=#>#kimkardashian</a> <a title=kourtneykardashian href=#>#kourtneykardashian</a> <a title=khloekardashian href=#>#khloekardashian</a> <a title=kardashians href=#>#kardashians</a> <a title=jenner href=#>#jenner</a> <a title=krisjenner href=#>#krisjenner</a> <a title=kendalljenner href=#>#kendalljenner</a> <a title=kuwtk href=#>#kuwtk</a> <a title=realitytv href=#>#realitytv</a> Scott Disick Jewish Video</p><a title="♬ original sound - 𝙃𝘼𝙈𝙎𝘼 𝘾𝙇𝙐𝘽" href=#>♬ original sound – 𝙃𝘼𝙈𝙎𝘼 𝘾𝙇𝙐𝘽</a></figure>View TikTok<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=mason-celebrated-his-bar-mitzvah-in-2022>Mason celebrated his Bar Mitzvah in 2022</h2><p>Although Scott is no longer in a relationship with Kourtney, the couple has been co-parenting on good terms.

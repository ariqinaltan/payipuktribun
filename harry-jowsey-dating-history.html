Harry Jowsey comes into the forefront on the second season of the streamer's <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/g26742354/best-reality-shows/>must-watch reality show</a>, which returned on June 7. Jowsey first came to reality TV fame after starring in the first-ever season of Too Hot to Handle in April 2020, where his relationship with <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://youtu.be/KN5JyOGD6d8?si=LxcJWTOwNSDrKjYZ" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Francesca Farago</a> was the main subject of discussion. (If you recall, Farago was a part of the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/tv-shows/perfect-match-cast/>Perfect Match season 1 cast</a>.) Four years later, Jowsey has spun out his reality fame to a stint on Dancing With the Stars, a high-profile podcast, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://open.spotify.com/show/33WUCfCGzkQLf5UQNArlvj referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Boyfriend Material</a>, an infamous OnlyFans, and a candle line.</p><p>Of course, Jowsey's best known for his loaded dating history, which immediately becomes a contentious subject once he arrives in the Perfect Match villa. For anyone who hasn't kept up with four years of influencer lore, read on for a primer on Jowsey's dating timeline, and how he entered into a love triangle with the winners of Perfect Match season 1.</p><h2 id=harry-jowsey-was-engaged-to-francesca-farago-3>Harry Jowsey was engaged to Francesca Farago.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/itjiw2ULmmpZEErfMfuAtd-1920-80.jpg><p>Jowsey and Farago's on-again-off-again relationship began when they both starred in Too Hot to Handle, coupled up, and established themselves as the rule-breakers who spent several thousand dollars on activities that robot host Lana did not approve. The pair were still together when they left the show, and they even visited each other in their respective countries—Farago traveled to his home in Australia and Jowsey flew to hers in Canada—but the pair eventually broke up by the summer of 2019.</p><p>However, by the time THTH season 1 dropped on Netflix in April 2020, the couple were back together, despite staying in different places during the pandemic. (Harry was in L.A. by then, while Francesca was still in Canada.)

Alas, the pair wasn't meant to be.

"I'm tall. I kind of look like a basketball player, maybe. I'm just unathletic. ... She's going through a tough time. Maybe she needs a laugh. Maybe she needs someone who's just going to come and make her giggle and have a good time."</p><p>"And then all this s--- comes out," Jowsey added, referring to the January 2022 reveal that <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson-cheating-expecting-baby-surrogate/>Kardashian had broken up with her ex Tristan Thompson</a>.

In season 1, Too Hot to Handle alum <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/who-is-georgia-too-hot-to-handle-season-3/>Georgia Hassarati</a> and The Mole star <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.instagram.com/dontcalldom/?hl=en" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Dom Gabriel</a> were <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/tv-shows/are-dom-georgia-still-together-perfect-match/>chosen as the strongest couple on the show</a>, winning a weeklong vacation anywhere in the world. However, the pair faced difficulties in their relationship after Perfect Match finished filming in early 2022. (Hassarati and Gabriel have offered differing statements on how long they stayed together.)</p><p>A few months after Perfect Match ended, Jowsey and Hassarati met when she appeared on <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1656922821353559" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>his podcast Tap In</a>. They soon began dating, though they have different claims about when; <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.tiktok.com/@dontcalldom/video/7206811217569025286 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Jowsey has said</a> that they hooked up the same night they met, while Hassarati <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://youtu.be/GgDWtVc0tgM?t=1895" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>denied the claim</a>. Regardless, the two Aussies soon made their relationship official, and they dated on and off for about a year until April 2023, per <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.eonline.com/news/1381941/too-hot-to-handles-georgia-hassarati-calls-out-ex-boyfriend-harry-jowsey-for-cheating-allegations referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>E! News</a>.</p><h2 id=harry-jowsey-had-a-quot-secret-girlfriend-quot-while-he-was-on-39-dancing-with-the-stars-39-3>Harry Jowsey had a "secret girlfriend" while he was on 'Dancing With the Stars.'</h2><p>In fall 2023, Jowsey joined one of the longest-running reality shows ever, competing on season 32 of Dancing with the Stars. Rumors about his dating life soon followed, with fans theorizing that the 27-year-old influencer was secretly dating his DWTS partner, 18-year-old professional dancer <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.instagram.com/ryleearnold1/?hl=en" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Rylee Arnold</a>—especially since DWTS has a <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/g37671738/dancing-with-the-stars-relationships-cast-dating/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>history of relationships among its cast</a>.</p><p>However, the dance partners made it clear throughout their season that despite their chemistry, they did not have a romantic relationship. Speaking with <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://people.com/harry-jowsey-dating-rumors-dwts-costar-rylee-arnold-unfair-8350257 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>PEOPLE</a> Jowsey said of the rumors, “I think that it's a little bit unfair on Rylee so early on. She's so green to this whole world and everyone having an opinion, and stuff like that ... We're trying our best to focus on the dance, and whatever happens, happens. We’re just enjoying being together.”</p><p>However, it did turn out that Jowsey was privately seeing someone during his DWTS tenure. In the first episode of his podcast <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/exposing-my-secret-relationship/id1556405287?i=1000654016015" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=skimlinks data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1662120&xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpodcasts.apple.com%2Fus%2Fpodcast%2Fexposing-my-secret-relationship%2Fid1556405287%3Fi%3D1000654016015&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marieclaire.com%2Fculture%2Ftv-shows%2Fharry-jowsey-dating-history" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - apple.com" data-merchant-id=undefined data-merchant-url=undefined data-merchant-network=undefined>Boyfriend Material</a> (produced by Unwell, the network from Call Her Daddy's Alex Cooper), the host revealed that he was in a relationship that he kept private while on the show. "What if told you I was actually in a secret relationship at the start of Dancing With the Stars all those edits and all that stuff kind of brought me and my girlfriend at the time apart,” he said.</p><p>He didn't reveal any details and bleeped out his mysterious ex’s name, though he did tell her, 'I miss you.' There have been no clues since, but assuming that Perfect Match was filmed before DWTS, there is a chance that his clandestine romance could have begun on the Netflix show.</p><h2 id=harry-jowsey-paired-up-with-jessica-vestal-on-39-perfect-match-39-3>Harry Jowsey paired up with Jessica Vestal on 'Perfect Match.'</h2><p>Jowsey debuted on Perfect Match season 2 in the premiere episode and initially paired up with fellow cast member and former Too Hot to Handle winner <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.instagram.com/elys_hutchinson/?hl=en" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Elys Hutchinson</a>. However, after the pair didn't work out, Jowsey matched with <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/tv-shows/jessica-vestal-perfect-match/>Love Is Blind alum Jessica Vestal</a>. He and Vestal have remained coupled over the show's first six episodes—making them one of the longest-lasting couples in the house. Jowsey even opens up about how much he admires Vestal, frequently praising her in confessionals for being a loving single mother and his physical type.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2TwWdaB9pKZVSqNtfVtLb-1920-80.jpg><p>However, the two have already had to contend with Jowsey's reputation in the Netflix reality sphere. Many of the women on the show have commented on how Jowsey may not be trustworthy as a committed partner and even Dom Gabriel, who is now close friends with Jowsey, commented on Harry's questionable behavior. Gabriel's comment led to an argument between Vestal and Jowsey, but he claims that he's turned over a new leaf—apparently, he's in his therapy era—and he's serious about her. Only time (and the remaining Perfect Match episodes) will tell.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJulocG2vsRoq69lo528uL%2BOoZirqqlit7DD0p6wZpyRqbavs4yhoKysn6fGcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

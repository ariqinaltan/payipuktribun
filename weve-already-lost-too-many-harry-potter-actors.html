Since Harris acted as Dumbledore only for the first two films, Gambon reprised the role of the iconic Hogwarts headmaster throughout the remaining six films of the franchise. "They rang me up and said, 'Will you do it?' Like any other job, I said, 'Sure.' Then you find yourself in the middle of this thing," Gambon once told <a href=#>Today</a> of his casting process.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though "Harry Potter" might have been a hit from the get-go, it took Gambon a while to fully grasp the importance of his role. He shared that it really hit him after running into a group of kids who wanted his autograph. "I got out of the limo in Leicester Square, there were 4,000 children screaming and then suddenly you become aware of how big this thing is," he recounted, via <a href=#>Insider</a>. The role of Hogwarts' headmaster added to his prolific career on screen and on the stage.</p><p>Sadly, on September 28, 2023, after a bout of pneumonia, Gambon died at the age of 82. "We are devastated to announce the loss of Sir Michael Gambon. Beloved husband and father, Michael died peacefully in hospital with his wife Anne and son Fergus at his bedside," his family said in a <a href=#>statement</a>. "We ask that you respect our privacy at this painful time and thank you for your messages of support and love."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbXBgZ4R2e9aerZ5lkaG%2Fpq3DsmSlp6OperW7zmakmqapYrWivtGyZKmnpKmys3nAnKuoqqNk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

In April 1865, following the assassination of the president, his body was taken by rail from Washington, D.C., to Lincoln's hometown of Springfield, Illinois, via New York City so that Americans along the way could mourn him. Ever since, on or around the anniversary of that initial rail journey, people have claimed to have witnessed a spectral echo of the funeral train between New York and Springfield.</p><p dir=ltr>While many ghost trains are described as simple lights or dark smudges, witnesses of Lincoln's funeral train have reported a number of spooky details. People claim that they can see inside the train an entire rail crew made up of skeletons, including a band playing silent dirges for the lost president. In the back half of the train is a flatcar that carries Lincoln's coffin, encircled by skeletons in Union Army coats. As the train passes, all clocks and watches stop until it has disappeared, usually leaving them six minutes slow. Others say the train pulls along with it darkness, cold, and clouds. The train has been sighted all over New York State, including in Grand Central Station, which hadn't even been built yet at the time of Lincoln's funeral.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kW5ncGxmZLSpu9KtZK2qkZ67tHnAq6auppRixLC%2By51m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

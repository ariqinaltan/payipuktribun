The sad day took place&nbsp;on&nbsp;November 11, 2022, and it was open to the public for free, but only for residents of Georgia. Some of the&nbsp;celebrities who paid their respects during the service&nbsp;included Cardi B, City Girls,&nbsp;Cee-Lo Green,&nbsp;Drake, Gucci Mane, Lil Yachty, Russell Simmons, and Teyana Taylor, with the likes of Yolanda Adams,&nbsp;Chlöe Bailey, and Justin Bieber performing. Atlanta's Mayor Andre Dickens was in attendance, as well.</p><p>A seemingly shattered Offset spoke about Takeoff at one point, giving what could be called a&nbsp;half-tribute, half-prayer. He also brought up&nbsp;Migos being credited for introducing a triple-time rap flow, in which artists rap in triplets.&nbsp;"[You] changed the culture of music forever, you did that, Take. You changed that flow," he said on stage (via&nbsp;<a href=#>HipHopDX</a>). "That flow came from Take, the originator. The originator of that flow. He changed the music. ... Lord give us the strength, give us the strength, the family and everybody, give us the strength. I don't want to question God, but I just don't get it." Offset's words reportedly left many in the arena weeping.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamphZoB5fo6wn5qsXabCosLOZpinnF2ks6e%2FxK1koZmmmnqjscSnZJ2nmaO0br%2FIp5qeZaSWuKa7xZ%2BqZpyVlsGpew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

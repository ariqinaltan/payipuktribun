Through our <a href=#>trusted and proven sources</a>, we can report that Dev Patel is currently in talks for the role of Mister Fantastic in the Fantastic Four reboot. This would be a huge addition, as Patel is a <a href=#>fantastic actor</a> who has graced the screen for films like The Green Knight, Slumdog Millionaire, Hotel Mumbai, and Lion.</p><p>There has been slow movement on the front of the new superhero <a href=#>team</a>, though Dev Patel heading up the role as Reed Richards in Fantastic Four would be amazing. He certainly has the gravitas and acting ability to make Richards an incredibly well-rounded character, especially one that could potentially be a mainstay in the <a href=#>MCU</a>. We do understand that this news might come as a significant blow to those hoping that <a href=#>John Krasinski</a> would be heading up the F4 team, but we are happy with Patel doing so, as well.</p><p>Now that Dev Patel is being brought along for the Fantastic Four movie, or presumably so, it means that he joins Matt Shakman as one of the <a href=#>key figures </a>of this new Marvel movie. Shakman was initially going to direct the Star Trek 4 sequel movie but opted out instead in favor of directing the Fantastic Four movie, which is certainly not a terrible choice. He technically gets to stay in the realm of science fiction, as Richards and the gang use all kinds of devices to further their understanding of the universe. Patel joining the MCU also indicates that we could be closer to a Doctor Doom casting, as well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/dev-patel-en-the-green-knight-900x506.jpeg><p>Dev Patel portraying Reed Richards of the MCU could mean that the world is going to see the Doctor Doom of the MCU soon, as well. We do know that Jonathan Majors is Marvel’s next big baddie, as he is going to be portraying Kang the Conquerer for the foreseeable future, and in his big movie appearance in Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. However, there are plenty of rumors that state the strings are being pulled by an even greater force, which could be none other than Doctor Doom.</p><p>Dev Patel would then be one of the key figures in attempting to stop Victor von Doom and his ploys to conquer the universe, well, the multiverse that is. Another interesting thing of note is that Avengers: Secret Wars is likely going to follow the 2015 Jonathan Hickman version of the comic book story, meaning God Emperor Doom will be one of the biggest villains shown. We could be seeing Doctor Doom appear in the MCU sooner rather than later.</p><p>Dev Patel is a great choice to portray Reed Richards, and his involvement in Fantastic Four means that we are now one step closer to finding out who else is going to be in one of the best superhero teams apart from the Avengers. Fans have been begging for Chris Evans to return as Johnny Storm, aka Human Torch, and we would certainly be on board with that, as well. Patel could certainly portray the reasonable character of the team, with Evans portraying the wisecracking wildcard personality.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2idqJi5tr%2FIr5xmnJWrerGt056jZp6Ro8Giv9Oimmaen6q%2Fb7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

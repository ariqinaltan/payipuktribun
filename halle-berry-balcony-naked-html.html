Two weeks ago, the <a href=#>Oscar</a>-winning actress took to Instagram to share some <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">naked selfies</a> of herself in the shower. Now, the 56-year-old star is once again causing a stir on the Meta-owned platform after posting a photo of herself hanging out on a balcony in the nude.</p><p>In the image, Halle Berry leans against a metal barrier attached to the enclosed platform, indulging in a glass of white wine. Although she’s entirely naked, she strategically positions her arms to conceal her chest. Moreover, the elegant guardrail casts a shadow on her lower body that obscures her intimate areas.</p><p>In the photo’s caption, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Moonfall</a> star wrote, “I do what I wanna do,” indicating that she is unapologetic about posing in her birthday suit. Going off some of the comments, her followers saw this statement as a declaration of independence and a message of empowerment for women. Throughout her career, Halle Berry has been a role model, encouraging women to make bold and confident choices.</p><p>The picture, which Halle Berry shared to her Instagram account less than 24 hours ago, has already garnered nearly half a million likes. Additionally, thousands of users took to the comments to praise the actress for her boldness and applaud her for promoting body positivity. Others, however, criticized the star for posting a nude photo on social media, arguing that it’s inappropriate and sets a bad example for younger women.</p><p>This isn’t the first time that Halle Berry has used her platform to promote self-expression and body positivity. In the past, she has spoken openly about her struggles with body image and the pressures of Hollywood to conform to unrealistic beauty standards. She has also advocated for greater representation of women of color in the entertainment industry, both in front of and behind the camera.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/moonfall023-900x675.jpeg><p>When Halle Berry isn’t advocating for social causes, she dedicates her attention to her thriving acting career. Last year, she starred alongside <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Aquaman</a> star, Patrick Wilson, in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Roland Emmerich</a>-directed sci-fi flick Moonfall. The plot of the film revolves around a team of astronauts who battle to rescue humanity from an impending catastrophe when an unknown power dislodges the moon from its orbit, sending it hurtling toward the Earth.</p><p>Up next, Halle Berry will star in Matt Charman’s science-fiction drama The Mothership. The film tracks the journey of Sara Morse (Berry) as she grapples with the sudden disappearance of her husband from their rural farm. When she discovers an unusual extraterrestrial artifact beneath their home, Sara and her children embark on a mission to locate her missing spouse, unearth the truth, and unravel the mystery.</p><p>Alongside Halle Berry, The Mothership stars Molly Parker, Colin O’Brien, Omari Hardwick, Spyro Curtis, John Ortiz, Sydney Lemmon, Paul Guilfoyle, Leah Procito, and Jaiden J. Smith. Matt Charman wrote and directed the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming</a> picture, which is set to premiere exclusively on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a>. Although no release date has been announced at this time, the film is expected to be released sometime this year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Klq6tnmJa5rbGMm5yrqqlir6K4wqilsmWelrimsI2hq6ak</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

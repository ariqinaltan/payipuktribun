This system of sand dunes comprises the largest continuous mobile coastal sand mass in the Southern Hemisphere. The sand dunes can climb as high as 30-50m. They are slowly creeping inland, changing daily with the winds and weather. 
What better a place to go sand boarding?

"Don’t worry," our friendly guide Mark Murphy said. "Rain makes it go a bit faster."</p><p>That sounds great, until you are sitting at the top of a 40m sand dune with a board under your bottom and an excited two-year-old tucked between your legs begging you to "GO mummy, GO."</p><p>So go we did, squealing all the way down the side of a pristine sand hill on the first run of the day.&nbsp;</p><p>With the wind in our hair and sand flying onto our legs we picked up speed and felt like we were flying. &nbsp;Once at the bottom there was no doubt we were going to climb that dune again. And again. And again.&nbsp;</p><p>Luckily, Port Stephens 4WD tours will let you stay at the dunes for as long as you &nbsp;like within their hours of 10am to 3.30pm.&nbsp;</p><p>But it sand boarding is not your style there are still other ways, more relaxing ways to take on the dunes. Like a camel ride. <a class=body-link href=#>Oakfield Ranch Camel Rides</a> are the camel rides that Lara Bingle rode on in the "Where the Bloody Hell Are you Ads".&nbsp;</p><p>The camels add to the illusion that you are in a foreign land. But it reality they take a walk across the dunes and onto the beach into the water before returning to the car park. It’s worth the cash just to see the kids' faces.&nbsp;</p><p>Want to take a tour of the sand dunes?

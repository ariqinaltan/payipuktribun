Overall, YoungBoy has had quite a few enemies over the years. Currently, his enemy <a href=# rel>seems to be none other than Joe Budden</a>. In fact, he is in a feud with Joe pertaining to the podcaster's criticism of his music. During a recent podcast episode, Joe said: "That n***a's trash. He's horrible. He is horrible. He is horrible. Really, really, really, really, really bad." <a href=# rel>Budden also went on to say</a> that the Youngboy love is inflated by YouTube numbers.</p><p>These comments subsequently led to a spirited rant by Youngboy himself. Overall, he went at Budden in a pretty brutal fashion. Moreover, he even took some shots at Joe's manhood. "Don't speak on me. I don’t play that s**t.” Don't rat on me neither, you p***y b***h," the rapper said. "Stupid dumb b***h, yo d**k don't get even hard no more, clown-a*s n***a. Ain't no sabotaging me, b***h. F**k wrong wit that n***a, mayne? Don't rat on me. I don't want to argue with ya b***h a*s, n***a. B***h, you do all them interviews, come on to Gravedigger Mountain and talk to me, n***a. B***h, if you can't do that, mayne, hey, you b***h-made n***a. Shut your f**kin' mouth!"</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Birdman Tells Charlamagne Tha God To "Respek" Drake</a></strong></p><span></span><p>Image via Instagram</p><p>In the Instagram story above, you can see that Birdman actually replied to Budden and in fast fashion, as well.

Driver and Damon initially met on the 1997 set of Good Will Hunting, and she was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for her role in the film.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Hudson mentioned Driver’s morose look at the Oscars (with a little visual aid that was shown on the screen), Driver responded, “My little face." She added that she'd like “to wrap my arms around that young woman and hug her and go, 'It’s all going to be fine honey, don’t worry.’”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Driver then went on to tell Hudson the advice she would give to her younger self. ”I wish I could have told her, ‘Honey it’s cool, you can celebrate and life’s gonna be great and beautiful and hard and amazing. You’re going to love again, it’ll be fine.’”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We’d recently broken up, I was nominated [for Best Supporting Actress], he was nominated. He had a new girlfriend, I was totally heartbroken," she explained. "I think it’s like anyone who’s been heartbroken can understand; it’s like the last thing you want is everybody having a window in on that and it was so public.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Driver and Damon have both moved on since. Driver is currently in a relationship with filmmaker Addison O'Dea, and she has a son, Henry, from a previous relationship. Damon has been married to his wife Luciana Barroso since 2005.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zKKlp6GVYrGztdWeqWaaopqurMHPZqSarKRisaK5zqdkqKuTlr9uwsidnKhlaGt9enyScQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

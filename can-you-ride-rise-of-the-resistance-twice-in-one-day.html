No, this was possible during the first couple of days of operation, but at this time <b>guests are restricted to one Virtual Boarding Pass for Rise of the Resistance per day</b>.</span></span><h2>How many times a day can you ride Rise of the Resistance?</h2>Is there a Limit on the Number of Times I Can Try for the Virtual Queue? No there isn't. Guests are limited to one RIDE per day on Rise of the Resistance, but if you can't get into the Virtual Queue on the first try, you can try again at 1:00 pm.<h2>How quickly does Rise of the Resistance fill up?</h2>But as we'll see shortly, Rise boarding groups still fill in the matter of about 15 seconds. Depending on how important Rise is, and how upset you'll be if you don't get it, you may want that person outside the data center to be more of a failsafe than the primary booker.<h2>Can you ride Star Wars twice?</h2>This is different than at Walt Disney World where everyone must purchase and could change at any time or be enforced differently by different cast members. The second group of riders can include three total people, so Star Wars loving big siblings can score a second ride on this amazing attraction!<h2>How many boarding groups are there for Rise of the Resistance per day?</h2>A good rule of thumb is that Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance averages about 12 boarding groups per hour. However, due to its reliability woes, sometimes that can be as low as 0 per hour or as high as 18 per hour. Over the course of most days, it averages out to about 10-14 per hour, though.<h2>How To CONQUER Disney World’s Most Stressful Ride – Rise of the Resistance</h2><p></p><h2>What is the highest boarding group for Rise of the Resistance?</h2>We were the first to report that Disneyland's Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance in Galaxy's Edge hit an all-time high boarding group of 330 on June 19th.

By spending $15 per person, you are as close to a guarantee of riding as possible. Not only will you experience a much, much shorter wait than other options, but you'll also be offered recovery options should there be a breakdown.<h2>Why do Disney rides break down?</h2>It's not that they're breaking down more, it's that social media/technology is used more and now it's reported every time a ride goes down. Older rides will have issues, and with newer tech, the new rides tend to go down because of “show” issues a lot.<h2>Can a pregnant woman ride smugglers run?</h2>Disney Advises Against Riding These Disney Hollywood Studios Attractions During Pregnancy: Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run.<h2>Can I ride Smugglers Run pregnant?</h2>Expectant mothers should not ride.

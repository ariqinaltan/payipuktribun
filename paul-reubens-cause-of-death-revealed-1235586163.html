A gifted and prolific talent, he will forever live in the comedy pantheon and in our hearts as a treasured friend and man of remarkable character and generosity of spirit.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In 1978, Reubens created Pee-wee while performing with the Los Angeles comedy troupe The Groundlings. He later took his performance on a 22-city tour of the U.S. as well as had it featured on an HBO special. From there, he went on to play the character in several projects for the big screen, including Pee-wee’s Big Adventure&nbsp;(1985) and Randal Kleiser’s&nbsp;Big Top Pee-wee&nbsp;(1988).</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The actor landed his own CBS Saturday morning children’s program,&nbsp;Pee-wee’s Playhouse, which ran for five seasons from 1986-91. The show also scored two Emmy Awards.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Apart from Pee-wee, Reubens also had roles in Batman Returns, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Dunston Checks In,&nbsp;Mystery Men, Blow, Life During Wartime and more.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Throughout his career, Reubens was also met with controversies. In July 1991, he was arrested for indecent exposure in an adult theater in Sarasota, Florida. He pleaded no contest to the charges and did 75 hours of community service.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Then, in 2002, he was charged in Los Angeles with misdemeanor possession of obscene material improperly depicting a child under the age of 18 in sexual conduct. The charges were eventually dropped, and he said that he was a collector of erotica.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Nearly a decade later, Reubens reprised his quirky character in 2010 in an updated revival of&nbsp;The Pee-wee Herman Show&nbsp;in Los Angeles and then on Broadway. He also produced a third Pee-wee film,&nbsp;Pee-wee’s Big Holiday, with&nbsp;Judd Apatow in 2015 for Netflix.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOqZiupF2nsrauxKeqZpuRqsCmec6fZJ2dkam1br7Er5yapJWZenJ%2Bkm5scW5ha4Bw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

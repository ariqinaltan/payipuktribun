The publication cites New York Times columnist Ross Douthat having <a href=# rel=nofollow>referred</a> to the Kevin Costner-fronted series as “the most red-state show on television,” along with Daily Mail having <a href=# rel=nofollow>suggested</a> that Yellowstone is too “anti-woke” to win awards.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“They refer to it as ‘the conservative show’ or ‘the Republican show’ or ‘the red-state&nbsp;Game of Thrones,'” Sheridan said ahead of the season five premiere for the show that focuses on the Dutton family’s ranch. “And I just sit back laughing. I’m like, ‘Really?'”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The prolific television producer continued, “The show’s talking about the displacement of Native Americans and the way Native American women were treated and about corporate greed and the gentrification of the West, and land-grabbing. That’s a red-state show?”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">With its impressive ratings, Yellowstone was considered to be among the most <a href=#>surprising 2022 Emmys snubs</a> when it failed to land a single nomination. Its lone nom throughout the course of its run thus far was for production design in 2021.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In a <a href=#>column reacting to the lack</a> of Emmy nominations for the show, The Hollywood Reporter chief television critic Daniel Fienberg said there was no truth to any assumption that TV Academy voters are too “woke” to appreciate the series.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“The argument that&nbsp;Yellowstone&nbsp;and shows of its ilk are discriminated against because of ideology is based on this peculiar insinuation that Taylor Sheridan and George Will are coffee-drinking companions,” he wrote. “Instead,&nbsp;Yellowstone&nbsp;is just a somewhat centrist drama in a genre that has traditionally leaned very slightly to the right. If TV shows could vote,&nbsp;Yellowstone&nbsp;and Emmy favorite (and, according to Netflix, massive hit)&nbsp;Ozark&nbsp;would probably support the same candidates.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Yellowstone’s season five premiere airs Sunday at 8 p.m. on Paramount Network.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOspylpJ%2BswLW7zZ5knKqVlsGwvoytmLKkn6d6tLTEq6CdmZ5iv6awjKyrmqyVYsCpu9ZmaGtrZWeDcYSUbGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

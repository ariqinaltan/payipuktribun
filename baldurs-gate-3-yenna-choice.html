There are plenty of unsavoury and unscrupulous characters in Baldur’s Gate 3, so you’re wise to ask this - as you’re never far from having a knife plunged in your back or waking up to find a &#34;friendly&#34; vampire at your neck. Don’t talk to strangers and all that!
But don’t let Yenna sit out in the cold and rain (or do): Read on to see what fate you might decide for Yenna and Grub in your journey through the Forgotten Realms."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

If you are doing an evil playthrough, then a charitable act to help save a child and her cat may not fly with you. If you sided with Minthara and kill everyone in Druid Grove, why stop now?</p><p>If you are the acing type, then Yenna will cook for you and your party, having learned from her mother who has disappeared. Her cat Grub is a cute addition to have in the camp too, and is quite a bit more cuddly-looking than the Sphynx cat in the Last Light Inn, His Majesty, - but perhaps not quite as funny.</p><p class="newsletter-sign-up__disclaimer body-copy-small">By entering your details, you are agreeing to our <a class="link link--styled" href=# data-component=Link>terms and conditions</a> and <a class="link link--styled" href=# data-component=Link>privacy policy</a>.

It also unsurprisingly won’t sit well with the rest of the group.</p><p>If you let Yenna stay then, as we mentioned earlier, Yenna will cook for the camp and provide good grub in the way of food (and the cat Grub too, of course).</p><p>She can get mixed up with the <a href=# rel=noopener>imposter</a> who is revealed to be in the camp during Act Three, and given that these two events coincide very closely to one another, it’s easy to point the finger at Yenna - but rest assured she is innocent.</p><p><strong>Read more on Baldur's Gate 3:</strong></p><p><strong>Subscribe to our <a href=# rel=noopener>free Gaming Newsletter</a> for weekly insights, and <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">follow us on Twitter</a> for all the latest updates.</strong></strong></p><p><strong>Looking for something to watch?

Absolutely fake advertising,” one fuming attendee said.</p><p>Attendees also slammed the company over ticket prices, with pre-purchased tickets costing $50 each for adults and $40 for kids, while tickets at the gate were $15 cash on the day.</p><p>“$15 a ticket … whoever paid $15 did well. My family and I – two adults and two children aged five and four paid $180, and we arrived at 1.30pm. That’s a f***ing joke,” one angry attendee wrote to a dedicated Facebook group.</p><p>“It was an absolute joke. I hope Calder Park makes a comeback, but the event organiser should be ashamed of themselves that he organised a mini Fyre festival,” another said in reference to an infamous luxury music festival founded by con artist Billy McFarland and rapper Ja Rule.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>Entry into the event was reportedly only possible via stairs, making the venue non-accessible for wheelchair users.</p><p>“I am so disappointed in yesterday, I paid for my two kids also, who are both under three, only to find out the day before when they made a post saying they are free. I paid $360 odd dollars for sunburn and sooky kids,” an annoyed mum said.</p><p>She said following the experience she would “never allow myself to be ripped off by this rubbish again”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7056aoaafobyoxY6mpq2nop67qHvCmqlmmZSrtqSxjqagp6Fdm8azsYyfnKysmauurXnPq6amp6Sav26%2BxJ%2BsrJ2jYr%2BmstSnm6xlkZvBpr6Mp6CgoKSirrOxjKamp6ukmr9uwNGumqRlo528uHvNnq6sZaOpvLPFjmxtb29jabByrZaam25rYmmAeK%2FCbG5pnmlrhKaBwXBt</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

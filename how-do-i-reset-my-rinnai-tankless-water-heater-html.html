Turn off all hot water faucets and taps in the house. Press the On/Off button twice to turn the device on or off. Restart the hot water system and do a test. It’s possible that you’ll have to repeat this process many times to completely reset the system.
 
Is there a reset button on a Rinnai tankless water heater, and if so, where is it? When attempting to connect or detach electricity from the tankless water heater, Rinnai suggests that you use the power plug on the water heater rather than the Reset function on the tankless water heater."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

If you ever find yourself needing to utilise the module’s Reset function, just put a tiny pin into the Reset aperture and press the button (see below).</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>In the same vein, why does my tankless water heater go cold?</h3><p>Another issue that tankless water heaters might encounter is the phenomenon known as a cold water sandwich. A cold water sandwich is a plumbing phrase that refers to abrupt temperature variations that occur when your tankless water heater alternates between producing hot and cold water. This may be caused by one of the following: a clogged water filter on the cold water entrance.</p><p></p><h3>It’s also important to understand what a code 11 on a Rinnai tankless water heater means.</h3><p>The presence of the Rinnai error number 11 indicates that there is no ignition in, or no gas supply to, your water heater. You may try the following solutions to see if they help: Make a visual inspection of your hot water system for evident damage or loose components. Locate your gas source and check to see that it is operational.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>What is the source of the beeping sound coming from my tankless hot water heater?</h3><p>When a water heater detects a leak, it may emit a beep to alert the homeowner. The presence of a leak may be visible if the floor is moist near the water heater, but the leak might be farther down the line. Depending on the equipment, the beeping might be caused by a water heater shutdown function or by a flood protection system. A gas leak may also be indicated by beeping.</p><p></p><h3>There were 21 related questions and answers found.</h3><p></p><h3>What is causing my electric tankless water heater to not heat up properly?</h3><p>To begin, reset any tripped circuit breakers and replace any blown fuses that have been discovered. Next, check to see whether electricity is being delivered to the thermostat for the electric water heating element. It is possible that the issue is caused by an inadequately sized water heater, crossed hot and cold connections, or a broken heating element or thermostat when the water does not heat up enough.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Is there a reason for the code 12 on a Rinnai tankless water heater?</h3><p>The presence of error code 12 indicates that your Rinnai hot water system has had a flame failure or has experienced a low gas flow. Gas is switched on at the gas metre or cylinder to ensure that it is working properly. Verify that the gas is switched on at the water heater before using it. Inspect the flue outlet to ensure there are no obstacles.</p><p></p><h3>On a tankless water heater, where is the reset button located?</h3><p>The water heater reset button is a red button that may be found on the water heater itself, as seen below (just above the thermostat). Some water heaters may feature two reset buttons, one for each thermostat, which might be useful in some situations. It may be necessary to remove the metal plate covering the thermostat, which is held in place by screws, in order to get access to the reset button.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>What are the drawbacks of using a tankless water heating system?</h3><p>The most significant downside of on-demand or instantaneous hot water heaters is the high initial investment required. The smaller units that are often seen will not be able to provide enough hot water to meet the needs of most families. They can only handle one faucet at a time, which is an issue if you want to take a shower while the dishwasher is in the dishwasher.</p><p></p><h3>What is the lifespan of tankless water heaters?</h3><p>a period of twenty years</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Do tankless water heaters need to be cleansed after they have been used?</h3><p>In order to prevent the development of calcium and other minerals inside the tankless water heater, tankless water heater manufacturers suggest that their units be cleansed at least once a year — and even more often if you have hard water. There are certain units that include an indicator that the unit needs to be flushed.</p><h3></h3><h3>What causes the reset button on a hot water heater to be triggered?</h3><p>This is the reset button, which is a red button placed on the water heater itself (just above the thermostat), which trips when the water temperature surpasses 180 degrees Fahrenheit. “ECO” (emergency cut off) and “high limit switch” are two terms that are occasionally used to describe the reset button.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Rinnai has a priority button, but what exactly is it?</h3><p>The “Priority button” on the temperature controller should be pressed. During this time, the green Priority light will illuminate, indicating that the Rinnai Tankless Water Heater is in control of the temperature and is ready to provide hot water. WARNING: The priority may only be adjusted when no hot water is being supplied to the faucet.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153 data-inserter-version=2></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154 data-inserter-version=2></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiZ3xxfY6hprBllKR6qnnRnqqerF2ixm6%2ByKelmqFdqa6vt8ueqqxlp5bBpr6MoZyarJWne6nAzKU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

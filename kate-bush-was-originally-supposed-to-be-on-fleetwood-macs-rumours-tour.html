One year later, after her 1979 European "Tour of Life" appearances, the still fledgling star stopped performing live concerts entirely. Her first time back on stage came more than three decades later, in 2014, based on <a href=#>BBC News</a> reporting. As BBC News goes on to note, her reasons for stepping back from touring in the 1970s were possible discomfort with flying as well as exhaustion, as <a href=#>Louder Sound</a> explains.</p><p dir=ltr>Though she never explained why she stopped performing concerts, there had also been an accidental death in the "Tour of Life" crew that upset the "Wuthering Heights" singer to the point she considered canceling. More than anything, though, the "Tour of Life" had an elaborate stage show filled with costume changes, a number of other performers, and projections. And in 1978, when Fleetwood Mac approached Bush about a spot on their tour, the spectacle that would become "Tour of Life" was still in the planning stages, as Louder Sound writes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kG5oaWhpZLiiwMRmma6rmGLEor%2BMqKmin5mjrq242GaqrqigpMCmsIytpmaalWK8r3nFpZyerKekvKV5zJqarGWiqrqwwdGsZK2npad8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

The divisional armourer was said to have declined the request. After two months, the fake ex-soldier was said to have shown up again at the division requesting to purchase pistols.</p><p>It was gathered that the armourer alerted the DPO, and the DPO in turn took up Ifada’s case to the CP. The suspect had further allegedly sent a text to the armourer, requesting how much he would pay to purchase the pistols.</p><p>In a bid to catch in the act, it was learnt that the armourer played along and charged N150,000 for one pistol.</p><p>Ifada was said to have proceeded to the division, where he selected a revolver and a berretta pistols in the armoury. He was subsequently arrested.</p><p>It was gathered that immediately the suspect was arrested, a search was also conducted in his house on Idowu Alimo Street, Idimu Road, where the police recovered items such as a walkie-talkie, a N300,000 cheque in his favour and a full military uniform.</p><p>Ifada, however, told the police that he was sent by a friend, one Kalu, with the cheque to buy the pistols. It's been learnt that efforts were ongoing to get the said Kalu.</p><p>Ifada explained that he had lied to the Idimu DPO that he was a retired captain and had made an Identity Card for such to be able to purchase the ammunition.</p><p>He said: <i>“I am into security equipment. I made the ID card for myself to ease my movement within security circle. I had told the DPO that I was a retired captain, because I loved to be a captain. I have never used the ID card to do anything negative.</i></p><p><i>“I met Kalu while passing through the Gowon Estate. When I inquired, I was told that Kalu was building a hotel in the area. So, I met the man to do business with him. I told him I was into electric fencing and could also install security cameras. He said he would take me to his house in Lekki. He also asked if I was a Christian, and I said yes. He signed a cheque of N50,000 saying he was sowing a seed for me.”</i></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkhHF%2Bl29loaydoQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

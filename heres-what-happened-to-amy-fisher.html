During the hearing she said, "You are being given a second chance in life, and I pray you will take it and make something positive out of all this tragedy."</p><p dir=ltr>Following her release from prison, Fisher returned to Long Island, where she was hired to write a column for the Long Island Press. She also wrote an autobiography, titled "<a href=#>If I knew Then</a>," about her experience, including her affair with Joey Buttafuoco, the shooting of his wife, and the aftermath. As reported by A&E, Fisher married former NYPD officer Lou Bellera in 2003.</p><p dir=ltr>In a 2003 interview with <a href=#>CBS News</a>, Fisher said she was dismayed that the incident was "glorified in the tabloids" and "became a big joke." However, she said, "It wasn't a joke." She described Buttafuoco as a predator, and said she "was abused by a man twice [her] age." Fisher said she was already vulnerable, as she had previously been sexually abused. When she met Buttafuoco, Fisher said she was struggling with low self-esteem and Buttafuoco "was able to maneuver his way into [her] life."</p><p dir=ltr>A&E reports Fisher began having cosmetic surgery, including breast augmentation, shortly after her release from prison. She also began working in the sex industry, which included guest appearances at gentlemen's clubs and in several adult films.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCEj2xucnBfnbKzsdJmrqGZpGK1orzPnqWenF2pvG6tzLJkn6GjnbKzew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

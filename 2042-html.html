According to the actress’ attorney Jonathan Wolfe, “This is a personal and private matter for Katie and her family. Katie's primary concern remains, as it always has been, her daughter's best interest." The Hollywood couple wed in a lavish ceremony in Italy in November 2006 with their daughter Suri, then just a baby, by their side.</strong></p><p>According to TMZ, the couple has a prenup. Together, they are worth a reported $275 million, with Cruise earning the bulk of that.</p><p>Cruise, who turns 50 on Monday, and Holmes, 33, have not been seen together in public since February when they attended an Oscars party together. The actress did not accompany her husband on the red carpet for any of his “Rock of Ages” premieres and was noticeably absent when he received the Friars Foundation's Entertainment Icon Award on June 12 – a big deal considering he is only one of four people to ever get the honor.</p><p>Her excuse? Holmes had to appear at an ice skating event in China. Instead, Cruise brought along Suri, 6, as his date, as well as his 17-year-old son Connor. "Katie's in China working," he said during his speech. "The women are all working. So Suri is my date this evening. Suri, thank you. My son Connor is [also] here. You guys really inspire me."Holmes, who has been in New York City with Suri while Cruise has been filming in Iceland, has certainly not been acting like a woman upset over the ending of her marriage.</p><p>The former “Dawson’s Creek” star has looked happier than she has in a long time in recent weeks, smiling for the cameras, walking around Manhattan, and hanging out with pals – which ironically is exactly how she was living her life before Cruise mysteriously swept her off her feet in April 2005, just weeks after she split from fiancé Chris Klein.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkf3GAkWefraWc</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

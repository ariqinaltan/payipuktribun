At that time, she relied heavily on her then-husband, Gilbert, for assistance. Her excessive weight had left her bedridden and struggling both mentally and physically. Her health was deteriorating rapidly as her weight began to affect her vital organs, including her heart, liver, and kidneys. Lupe admitted to losing all motivation and even found it difficult to breathe due to her weight. Diabetes had also become a concerning issue. Her kidneys were at risk of failing if she didn’t take action.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>Turning Point:</strong></h3><p>Despite the challenges she faced, Lupe finally decided to make a change. She set her sights on improving her health, much like Julian from My 600-lb Life, who underwent an astonishing transformation. Lupe’s dedication to her health marked the beginning of her incredible journey to a healthier life.</p><h3><strong>Lupe’s Progress:</strong></h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>In the years following her My 600-lb Life episode, Lupe has continued to thrive.

Her passion for portrait photography also keeps her creatively engaged. Similar to Syreeta from My 600-lb Life, Lupe has pursued various interests while prioritizing her health.</p><h3><strong>Life After the Show:</strong></h3><p>In an exciting update, Lupe shared that she has moved on from her previous life in San Bernardino, California, and now resides in San Antonio. What’s even more astonishing is that she has gone from a staggering 642 pounds to now weighing under 200 pounds. Her transformation is nothing short of inspiring.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>Finding Love and Loss:</strong></h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Lupe’s journey isn’t just about her physical health. She also found love again with a new partner, Andrew Renteria. However, tragedy struck when Andrew faced kidney problems and passed away two years later.

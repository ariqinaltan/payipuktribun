His passion and dedication to the sport have inspired many aspiring wrestlers and commentators, and his influence on the industry will be felt for generations to come. A long-time friend of “The King” recently revealed that Lawler has been pitching Andy Kaufman’s induction into the Hall of Fame for many years.</p><p>Andy Kaufman was announced as the latest inductee in the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2023. Kaufman had a unique and unconventional professional wrestling career. He was a comedian and actor who became involved in the wrestling world in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Kaufman’s approach to wrestling was to play a “heel” character, or a villain, who would taunt and insult the audience and his opponents.</p><p>Kaufman’s involvement in wrestling was controversial at the time, as many people saw it as a mockery of the sport. However, Kaufman insisted that his wrestling performances were part of his comedic act and that he was not trying to make fun of wrestling itself. He famously feuded with wrestler Jerry “The King” Lawler, which included Kaufman being “injured” in the ring by Lawler.</p><p>Despite the controversy surrounding his wrestling career, his unique approach to wrestling has influenced many performers and has had a lasting impact on the industry. Andy Kaufman will be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as part of the 2023 class along with Rey Mysterio and The Great Muta during WrestleMania 39 weekend.</p><p>According to Lawler’s former broadcast partner Jim Ross, despite being enemies on-screen and many people thinking the conflict between them was real at the time, Lawler has always desired for Kaufman to be given the same accolade he did in 2007, an induction into the WWE Hall of Fame on the <a href=#>latest edition of “Grilling JR”</a>.</p><p>“That’s great, that’ll make Lawler very happy. Jerry has been lobbying for that for a long time and I think deservedly so. I mean, gosh almighty, if you’re looking at impactful moments, impactful characters that established a footprint that will be ever-lasting in pro wrestling history, you know, Andy Kaufman qualifies … He was a unique dude and he got over because he was different. He was different and he wasn’t afraid to take chances.”</p><p>Andy Kaufman tragically passed away at the age of 35 in 1984. It is unknown who will accept the honor on his behalf or who will induct the legendary comedian. Lawler would have been a choice to induct the late Kaufman, but <a href=#>“The King” suffered stroke last month</a> and hasn’t been making public appearances since the life-threatening occurrence.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><strong>Are you happy with Andy Kaufman’s Hall of Fame induction?

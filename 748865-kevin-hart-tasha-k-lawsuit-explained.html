However, as the year came to a close, popular YouTuber Tasha K was served a lawsuit of her own by none other than actor and comedian Kevin Hart. The famed star of Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle sued Tasha K and his former assistant for defamation and extortion following one of the latest episodes of Unwine With Tasha K.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Of course, this isn't the first time an A-List celebrity has taken Tasha K to court. In March 2023, a judge upheld <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Cardi B's $4M defamation judgment against Tasha K.</a> Being hit with another lawsuit just months after is certainly not a good look for the Internet personality. Kevin Hart sued on December 27, 2023, and this is still a developing story. Nevertheless, here’s what we know about the lawsuit against Tasha K so far.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-the-allegations-against-kevin-hart>The Allegations Against Kevin Hart</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The root of the matter is an interview Kevin Hart’s former assistant recently had with Tasha K. The video was published on Tasha K’s YouTube and Instagram accounts on December 22, 2023. Miesha Shakes, who worked for Hart from 2017 to 2020, appeared on Unwine with Tasha K, and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">accused her former boss of several things</a>, from impregnating a flight steward to regularly cheating on his wife. Speaking to Tasha K, Shakes said, “It is the time for Hollywood to hear this story. Especially because a lot of people are locked in non-disclosures and they are not able to talk and protect themselves, but you have to protect the person you’re working for. Where’s your protection?”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Chiefly, Shakes alleged that Hart had an extramarital affair, which she claimed she informed his wife Eniko about. Also, she claimed that Hart had a gambling problem. When Tasha K asked if Hart&nbsp;“gambled y’all money away and had to pay y’all half cheques,” Shakes affirmed it, saying “Yes, well, exactly.” This expectedly sent social media into a frenzy.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-kevin-hart-responds-with-a-lawsuit-against-tasha-k>Kevin Hart Responds With A Lawsuit Against Tasha K</h2></span><p>ATLANTA, GA - MARCH 11: Kevin Hart performs at Uptown Comedy Club on March 11, 2016 in Atlanta, Georgia.

The actor filed his complaint at the Los Angeles Superior Court. Subsequently, the document was obtained by PEOPLE, revealing information about the case.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">According to the document, in November, an unnamed person&nbsp; “affiliated with Kebe” reached out to a representative of Hart’s. This person allegedly informed Hart’s representative that an interview that “would be damaging to Hart’s reputation” had been recorded. Afterward, according to the document, “the individual stated that Kebe would publish the interview unless Hart paid a ransom of $250,000.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Hart allegedly contacted the police after, issuing a cease and desist order to Tasha K. It highlighted the NDA between Hart and Shakes, citing that posting the interview would be a breach of contract on Shakes’ part. However, Tasha K went ahead to post the video, and Hart hit her with a lawsuit soon after. Now the YouTuber is clearly in some hot water, as onlookers wait to see how things will play out.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-what-s-next-for-tasha-k-amp-miesha-shakes>What's Next For Tasha K & Miesha Shakes?</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">According to the file obtained, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Kevin Hart is suing both Shakes and Tasha K</a> for civil extortion, and invasion of privacy. Additionally, he has charged Shakes with breach of contract and defamation. Moreover, he is suing Tasha K for intentional interference with contractual relations. The infamous YouTuber has a reputation for airing allegations against celebrities that sometimes turn out to be false. Hart’s lawsuit even states that Tasha K “has an established history of posting defamatory and otherwise improper content regarding celebrities.” Overall, it’s not looking good for either of the two defendants, but the case could go either way. More information will be revealed in the coming days.&nbsp;<br></p><p>About The Author</p><p>Demilade Phillips has been a Features Writer for HotNewHipHop since 2023.

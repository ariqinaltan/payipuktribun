Every major player in the nonscripted space has been trying to make reality TV interactive, to stitch together the AARP-heavy live TV audiences with millennial-friendly multiscreen viewers. Everyone, so far, has failed. (Remember ABC’s short-lived Rising Star? Didn’t think so.)
5 Gold Rings is Talpa’s big interactive play. The trivia show, in which contestants place gold rings over their answers on a giant LED screen while viewers play along at home on their phones, has just been renewed for a second season on Britain’s ITV and is also on the air in France and the Netherlands."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Compared to <span data-scayt_word=Talpa data-scaytid=8>Talpa</span> juggernauts like The Voice, it is still a minnow, sold to just a handful of territories. NBC commissioned a U.S. pilot of the format but passed on the series, and <span data-scayt_word=Talpa data-scaytid=11>Talpa</span> is currently rethinking its American strategy.</p><p>“It’s a very technical show, and we are attempting to have the exact same game on mobile devices as we have on live TV,” says de Mol. “The challenge is to get the viewer to download the app and play along, but the penetration [for the U.K. version] was very high and will hopefully grow in season two.”</p><p>Interactive or not, <span data-scayt_word=Talpa data-scaytid=13>Talpa</span> is betting big on a game show revival at this year’s <span data-scayt_word=MIPCOM data-scaytid=15>MIPCOM</span>, with an array of formats, including The Big Picture, Divided and What Do I Know?, tapping into a new vogue for the genre (think ABC’s revivals of Match Game and Pyramid).</p><p>“You see that this genre, one of the oldest genres on television, is coming back,” says <span data-scayt_word=Meijs data-scaytid=16>Meijs</span>. “The challenge is always to be original, to add interactive technology components when they make sense and, most of all, to take risks.”&nbsp;</p><p>This story first appeared in the Oct. 4 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

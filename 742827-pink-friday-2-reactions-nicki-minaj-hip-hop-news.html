Of course, it's pretty early to really come to a conclusion on what the consensus behind <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Pink Friday 2</a> is. We're sure that some beats will grow on us, we will understand bars more with each listen, some features won't be as exciting as when we first heard them, and so on. But on Onika's 41st birthday, on the very first day we got our ears on it, how is it shaping up? Well, according to the fans... good! But it depends on who you ask.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Obviously, a lot of fans of <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Megan Thee Stallion</a>, Latto, or other femcees probably don't like Pink Friday 2 that much. Apparently Nicki Minaj had plenty of <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">subliminal disses and shots for the female rap game</a>, which is disappointing to see from just a solidarity standpoint. With these conflicts and comparisons in mind, you'll obviously find a lot of hate towards the project online from other female rap fans, which is very understandable. If you've liked the Barb before, you'll probably like this record, but if you prefer other styles, it might not do much for you.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-barbz-are-loving-nicki-minaj-s-latest>Barbz Are Loving Nicki Minaj's Latest</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, there's also a lot of convo about the featured guests: <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Young Money</a> (Lil Wayne & Drake), <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Future</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Uzi Vert</a>, and more. Particularly, there was even some conversation around Drizzy's appearance on here being better than a lot of what made it to For All The Dogs.

He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnaX95fpZmp6Kmm2Kzs7XDmrBmal2nsqKv06Kmp6tdo7akt8hmpKKmkZ96qbXPZp%2BoqF2jsri%2F</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

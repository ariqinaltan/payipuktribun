At 14 years old, Love experienced his father Orbin Love’s sudden and heartbreaking death from lung cancer; an experience which continues to leave an impactful imprint upon both lives. Orbin himself played college football himself; playing an integral part in instilling Jordan with love of football while developing his talent particularly as quarterback position player.</p><p>Orbin played an instrumental role in Jordan’s athletic journey; not only was he instrumental in his introduction to football but he was also his first coach from an early age, molding and nurturing him until eventually Jordan’s eventual success as an athlete in football was built up through this early exposure and continuous support from an early age. Unfortunately, Orbin died tragically a mere few days before turning 52 as the result of suicide which greatly saddened Jordan; nonetheless he continues to honor both his memory as well as remember all that valuable knowledge that his father imparted upon him both on and off the field of play.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong><strong>The Tragic Loss of Orbin Love</strong></strong></h2><p>Orbin Love’s death was not only heartbreaking for Jordan and his family but a tremendous loss for Bakersfield as well. Changes to medication lead to abnormal behavior which ultimately resulted in his taking his own life by using his service weapon as means for self-destruction. Jordan often recalls fondly how they went everywhere together and the impactful role his father had had in shaping his life. He mourns him dearly.</p><p>Orbin Love continues to be remembered with honor ten years after he passed, both by family members and the wider community he served. On the 10th anniversary of his passing, Bakersfield Police Department’s official Instagram account honored Orbin by honoring all he contributed while remembering how loved he was by coworkers and community members alike – with one post remembering Orbin with fond memories as an inspirational figure with an infectious laugh who touched lives all across Bakersfield with his beautiful smile and faith-driven outlook on life he left in those around him.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Jordan Love’s Professional Journey and Achievements</strong></h2><p>Jordan Love’s journey to becoming the starting quarterback for the Green Bay Packers is one of resilience and determination. After being persuaded by his father to pursue football over his initial inclinations towards basketball, his talent and hard work led him to a stellar collegiate career at Utah State. Deciding not to return for senior year and declare for NFL draft 2020 has opened new chapters of his life; ultimately leading to him being selected 26th overall by Packers as draftee.</p><p>Jordan excelled as a backup quarterback during his first two seasons before earning the starting nod following Aaron Rodgers’ departure for New York Jets. Love’s performances during games such as his impressive outing against Chicago Bears where he completed 15 of 27 passes for 245 yards with 3 touchdowns prove his growing prowess as an NFL quarterback. Without doubt his father played an influential role in shaping him into an athlete; Jordan credits much of his success to their early encouragement and support from him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbjAp5ylpJmdsrOty51lnKedZH52g5RsZqiqkp67brjOr5xmp5Kewbat0bJksKCRqXqprc%2BpnKedlGLBsHnJqKmdmZ5iubDCxGadmqyYmr9w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

According to the journalist, more of the 23-year-old's texts were read this morning. Among them was a brief conversation between Melly and Peezy Gambino on October 26, 2018.

They chiefly expressed concerns that the texts being read by Det. Moretti and others and "destroying" their client's image. The presiding judge denied their request, and after a lunch recess, one of the Florida native's lawyers asked to go home <a href=# rel>due to illness</a>. The trial was then cancelled for the remainder of the week, with a plan to resume proceedings this morning. While they're definitely making more progress than the YSL RICO trial, it's been said that Melly could be in court for a few more weeks still.</p><p>Before the unexpected pause in YNW Melly's double murder trial last week, we heard one of the embattled rapper's friends testify against him. According to the prosecution's witness, the "Murder on My Mind" hitmaker changed clothing from the time he was last seen with his alleged victims to when he arrived at Fredo Bang's house later that night. Read more about that at the link below, and check back later for more hip-hop/pop culture news updates.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel>YNW Melly‚Äôs Friend Testifies That Rapper Switched Clothing Before Going To Fredo Bang‚Äôs House</a></strong></p><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmboNygJNmsKevXaKyrbjYZquesKRiuqa%2F0pqenqtdmLy2vtNmoGacmZl6tbTArQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.

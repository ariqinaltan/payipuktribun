Consequently, he is officially off house arrest, and a free man. To celebrate, Boosie Badazz held a pool party of sorts. In the video down below, you can see that Boosie decided to have his family around as he cut his ankle monitor off. He seemed to be in great spirits, which makes sense given the occasion. After cutting off the monitor, he jumped into the pool, albeit with some socks on.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-boosie-badazz-has-a-party>Boosie Badazz Has A Party</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Fans were happy for Boosie as they offered up some commentary on his big win. "Wonderful news to start off my day," one person wrote. "I love this for bro," said another. Others simply looked to make fun of Boosie, although those people are just hating for the sake of it.

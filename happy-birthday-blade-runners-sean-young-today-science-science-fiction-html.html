Even though it wasn’t a financial success and earned mixed reviews at the time, its reputation has only grown as the years passed, and now it’s widely regarded as one of the best science fiction film of all time. For actress Sean Young, the role of the unwitting replicant Rachel has defined her career from that moment forward, which has got to be a blessing and a curse. She’s continued to appear in films and TV in the years since, but none of those roles have pulled her out from under Rachel’s long shadow. Still, the fact that people still remember and connect with that role some 30 years later, that’s an accomplishment few performers can claim. Young turns 54 today, and GFR wishes her a happy one!<span id=more-79357></span></p><p><b>Today in Television</b></p><p><b>Doctor Who: The Tenth Doctor Marathon (BBC America, 2 a.m. / 1 a.m. Central)</b><br>David Tennant’s tenure is arguably the most beloved of the modern incarnations, because damn did he give good Doctor.

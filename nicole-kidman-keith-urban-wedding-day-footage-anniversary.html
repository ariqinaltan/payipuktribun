She kisses him on the red carpet (even after <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>locking lips with Alexander Skarsgård</a>). Their romance is so cinematic you’d expect them to have dreamy (and dare we say, corny) video footage from the early days.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We imagine such a clip would feature Kidman in an angelic white wedding dress, with Urban’s signature highlights glowing as a montage shows us flashes of the church at which they exchanged vows. Perhaps we’d see statue of an angel here, a skyline there...</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It turns out something like this exists, and Kidman quietly dropped it for the viewing pleasure of her unsuspecting 1.3 million Instagram followers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The couple is celebrating their 12th wedding anniversary on Tuesday, and to honor it, Kidman uploaded the aforementioned video to social media, giving us a taste of what their big day was like in Manly, Australia. Indeed, the clip is dated (in a nostalgic way), just the right amount of cheesy, and could easily pass for a clip from a Nicholas Sparks adaptation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jokes aside, she truly does look magnificent in the montage, where we see the wedding dress that’s become so infamous, it’s even been <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>displayed at a museum</a>. Kidman wore a custom Nicolas Ghesquière-designed Balenciaga gown that's rumored to have cost $20,000. For that price, it makes sense that she’s still in love with it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It’s the most exquisite dress and it is so beautiful,” she told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>E! News</a> in 2015. “Nicolas [Ghesquière] made it for me and it is wrapped in special paper and it will be passed on to whichever daughter wants to wear it. I still have so many of my dresses. I treat them as you would a painting because that’s what they are—they’re just in a different form.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Urban also shared a flashback clip to celebrate their milestone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin made “conscious uncoupling” a thing, we’ve found its opposite meaning: “celestial synergized soul dancing.” Thanks, Keith.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGeenrCwuMRmoqKcnZa7brfEoquhZaWnr6K6jLCcnZyZo7RusMCyZJ%2Bnn6muqLGMmqWnoaaav7St0bI%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

data-sourcepos=7:1-7:127><strong>Let's be blunt (pun intended):</strong><span> Getting caught with edibles at Las Vegas Airport is a party foul.</span><span> Here's what could happen:</span></p><ul data-sourcepos=9:1-10:165><li data-sourcepos=9:1-9:208><strong>The Confiscation Tango:</strong><span> TSA will politely confiscate your stash,</span><span> like that bouncer taking away your fake ID in college.</span><span> </span><strong>Consider it a forced donation to the "Oops, I Forgot I Had Edibles" bin.</strong></li><li data-sourcepos=10:1-10:165><strong>A Brush with the Law:</strong><span> In some cases,</span><span> depending on the amount and,</span><span> well,</span><span> the mood of the officer,</span><span> you might get a visit from the local constabulary.</span><span> This could lead to a fine or worse,</span><span> a serious buzzkill.</span></li><li data-sourcepos=11:1-12:0><strong>Missing Your Flight:</strong><span> Look,</span><span> dealing with law enforcement isn't exactly conducive to making your flight on time.</span><span> Be prepared to explain your situation and potentially reschedule your trip.</span></li></ul><p data-sourcepos=13:1-13:153><strong>Important Note:</strong><span> This is all hypothetical,</span><span> of course.</span><span> TSA doesn't actively search for edibles,</span><span> but if they find

the best policy.</span><span> Be polite,</span><span> cooperative,</span><span> and accept the consequences.</span></p></li><li data-sourcepos=31:1-32:103><p data-sourcepos=31:5-32:103><strong>How to

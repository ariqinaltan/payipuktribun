Still starring both rappers, The Wash will now be conveyed as a television series. DJ Pooh, the director of the original 2001 film, took to Twitter to confirm the upcoming project. "It all comes out in 'The Wash,'" he wrote, "series coming." The post was accompanied by an orange pail and hanging car freshener, both which were branded with the movie's logo.</p><p>The 53-year-old film director first hinted at the resurgence of The Wash in an Instagram post back in December. The photo showcases a scene featuring his character, Slim, along with Mr. Washington and Face (played by George Wallace and Sean Fonteno respectively). The original film also boasted a star-studded cast, including <a href=# class=text-word rel>Eminem</a>, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Ludacris</a>, and Shaq. Unsurprisingly, the soundtrack for the 2001 comedy amounted to a significant effort, with features from Truth Hurts and Xzbit among others, both of whom also made appearances in the film. Of course, both Snoop and Dre also added their flare to the movie's music. The long-established partners collaborated on the songs "On the Boulevard" and "The Wash."</p><span><h2 id=h-the-wash-series-is-underway>"The Wash" Series Is Underway</h2></span><p>Although it is unclear when the TV series will grace our screens, we can only hope it continues to capture the lives of Dee Loc and Sean (played by Snoop and Dre). In the original film, these two roommates take up a job at a car wash in order to pay rent. The endeavors of Dee Loc and Sean result in an action-packed comedy that continues to be referenced today. Most recently, Blxst and Bino Rideaux paid homage to the film in their music video for "Movie."</p><p>Snoop and Dre will also be joining forces in their upcoming album, <a href=# rel>Missionary</a>, which follows three decades after the release of Doggystyle. When the "Bad Decisions" rapper initially announced the new project on Instagram, he cited his partnership with Dre as a "dynamic duo." Missionary is expected to drop this summer.

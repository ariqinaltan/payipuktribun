The truth is that their relationship was not particularly long, lasting about a year and a few months. In fact, they separated even before the baby was born. However, now they might have given each other a chance again.</p><p>Not without controversy, of course. Already in August there was speculation that the couple might be back together, but neither of them confirmed anything about it. It should be noted that she was in Madrid with her daughter, presumably to help her ex given the injury suffered by the defender, and that keeps him away from the playing field.</p><p>However, a few weeks earlier, Militao presented his other girlfriend, also an 'influencer', <strong>Cassia Lourenco</strong>. Something that did not sit entirely well with Lima, who uploaded a photo to Instagram immediately with a t-shirt that read "my ex is my biggest fan".</p><p>He posted an image with his new partner to, later, delete it when the relationship ended.</p><figure class="ue-c-article__media ue-c-article--media-icon-m-from-tablet ue-c-article__media--video"></figure><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>The clues behind the alleged reconciliation</h2><p>Lima and Militao's daughter recently turned one year old and that may have been a turning point between the two, although neither has wanted to talk about it. However, it seems that they have come closer together, presumably for the welfare of their daughter.</p><p>The <a href=#><strong>Real Madrid</strong></a> player has given a 'like' to a photo that his ex-partner has uploaded to social networks, so in Brazil there is already talk of an alleged reunion between the two. For the moment, we will have to keep an eye on social media, although it would not be surprising that, in the case of getting back together, they would make it public, since both, especially her, are very fond of posting on networks.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqWgn52jqcatsY6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGZraGJofHJ8jmtsaG5laIZ0fpWeaWtuYGaxp62Wmm%2BbbGWXhW%2B006aj</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

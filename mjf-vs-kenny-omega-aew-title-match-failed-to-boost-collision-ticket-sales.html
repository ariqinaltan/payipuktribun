AEW brought the best show they could for Dynamite this week. They booked that MJF vs Kenny Omega match during the show. The company also reminded fans of the big match during Rampage."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The discount code or deal failed to generate a significant increase in ticket sales, leading to the suggestion of removing them and lowering the price point.</p><p>The outlet went on to state that despite the announcement of the MJF and Kenny Omega match, ticket sales did not experience the expected surge, possibly influenced by higher prices compared to Philadelphia. Notably, the three most camera-visible sections in the lower bowl maintained pricing at $86, $125, and $86, respectively. It’s important to mention that this pricing model includes service fees within the ticket price.</p><p>It is worth noting that the Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, CT has a recorded total capacity of 10,000, but AEW isn’t going to even have half of that available for this week’s Collision. This falls in the line with a growing trend of AEW booking large venues and only setting up a percentage of the space for their show.</p><p>We will have to see how AEW Collision turns out this week. It could be a great show, and they have some good matches booked. Only time will tell how many fans show up, and the final viewership number on television as well.</p><p>What’s your take on AEW Collision? What can they do to really increase ticket sales?

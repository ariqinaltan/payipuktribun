Although Bailey has said that she has forgiven her mother, she had not seen her in decades at the time of the report — although her mother had texted her more than once to ask for money.</p><p dir=ltr>Bailey went on to have a fairly normal life, earning a nursing degree and starting a medical uniform business, which she runs with her now ex-husband.

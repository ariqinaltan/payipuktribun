He has deep love for Japanese wrestling in general and so it comes as no surprise, Nakamura is<a href=#> very excited about his upcoming match against The Great Muta</a>. In fact, Vince McMahon initially declined Nakamura’s request for the match, which Triple H eventually approved.</p><p>It was announced back in October that Shinsuke Nakamura will square off against The Great Muta at the NOAH The New Year show on January 1st, 2023. Fans are very excited about this match, which is a dream come true for many.</p><p>While speaking to&nbsp;<a href=#>Yahoo Sports</a>, Nakamura discussed the upcoming match with the Japanese legend. Nakamura revealed that Vince McMahon initially declined his request to face Muta, which Triple H approved once he became the head of WWE Creative.</p><p>I was like, “No way. I couldn’t believe it. I didn’t think it would happen. It was something that would never have happened under the previous structure of the WWE. Noah came to me with the idea, and we discussed it, but my answer was no. Vince (McMahon, Chairman and CEO of WWE) stepped down in the summer, and I was advised by people within the company that it might be possible now. I still thought it would be difficult, but I even talked directly to Triple H (WWE’s vice president). When the decision was actually made, I was shaken.”</p><p>There was a big change in the WWE between when Mutoh announced his retirement and when the match was decided. Vince, who was the symbol of everything, was retiring, and that was something that no one could believe. Everything changes in America when the top changes. At that time, there was a feeling that many things would change in the future. One of the changes that occurred to me was this. The fact that ‘no’ became ‘yes’ gave me a boost.”</p><p>Triple H also reached&nbsp;<a href=#>out to NOAH about the match</a>. Vince McMahon rejecting the match was <a href=#>already known fact</a> which Nakamura simply confirmed now. Regardless, we’ll have to see how the match will turn out.</p><p><strong>What’s your take on what Shinsuke Nakamura said?

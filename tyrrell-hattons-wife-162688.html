Tyrrell Hatton has claimed multiple titles on the DP World Tour over the past few years and finally got into the winner's circle on the PGA Tour at the 2020 Arnold Palmer Invitational.¬†
Throughout all of his successes, there has been one individual who has been part of his support team.

Since graduating, she has been seen regularly at tournaments, following her husband around the world.&nbsp;</p><p>As well as travelling, Braisher also has a blog called 'Wife on Tour', in which she writes about her thoughts, feelings and experiences whilst travelling around with Hatton.</p><p>When she created the website, the pair weren't married, with Braisher claiming 'Girlfriend on Tour' didn't have the same type of ring to it. That being said, given the recent wedding, it is now factually accurate!</p><figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check></figure><p>She goes on to say; 'The ‚ÄòWAG‚Äô (I hate the stereotype that comes along with that acronym) lifestyle can come across as nothing short of glamour and bliss, but in reality being away from home and living out of a suitcase can be really tough at times.'</p><p>She has written blogs on The Masters and the US Open at Erin Hills in 2017. However, she has struggled to maintain the blog due to her hectic schedule with Tyrrell.</p><figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check></figure><p>The pair got engaged in December 2019, with the pair tying the knot in 2021. For the wedding, Hatton actually arrived half an hour late: ‚ÄúIt was funny ‚Ä¶ the day wasn't very smooth,‚Äù said Hatton, who travelled to Asheville, North Carolina, with Braisher for their intimate wedding.</p><p>‚ÄúOur driver turned up an hour late, so that meant we arrived half an hour late for our ceremony, and then because we wanted it in the Blue Ridge Parkway, and we wanted to hike up and have some nice pictures. Unfortunately, after finishing the ceremony, it absolutely pissed down with rain, and we then had to drive like two miles down the road, pulled over in a lay by, and we had our wedding pictures on the side of the road. So, yeah, not quite as magical as you'd plan it, I guess, but it was still pretty special.‚Äù</p><p>A funny story involving the couple came at the 2019 Italian Open, when Braisher accidentally put Hatton off when he was mid-swing. She did so by shutting a toilet door which led to the funny exchange.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tyrrell Hatton‚Äôs fianc√©e decided to distract him during his backswing with a bathroom door.

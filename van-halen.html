 Jun 14th 2020 !⃝ You all are wrong. Also parcally right. I met Pete Angelis outside Cobol. I was 17 and Pete was VH's sound man. One time Dave's enemy turned into best friend then partners as the other half of the Picasso bros. Now, you'll have to ask one of them what's up. I have no dog in that fight or race.

Also parcally right. I met Pete Angelis outside Cobol. I was 17 and Pete was VH's sound man. One time Dave's enemy turned into best friend then partners as the other half of the Picasso bros. Now, you'll have to ask one of them what's up. I have no dog in that fight or race. Big Eddie was their bodyguard. Wonder how he's doing. Anyway. I'm from Detroit. I mean DETROIT. Not the suburbs, Warren, St Clair Shores or any west side Detroit or it's suburbs. Farmington . East side. Davison / Mound. I did 4 hour's with Van Halen Dave era. Then 2 Dave solo tours. Trust me. Tycoons and a dancer named Madison does have lot's to do with it. After the fact. But no. It's really about setting your mind on something you're told no, you can't have it. From a girl to anything. Then like saying I'll bet you 5 bucks, watch this... I'll get her. Then making that you can't, or no, into your Bitch! Dave is a really smart guy. So smart, most people don't know what he means or what did he say? Lol. I used a family friends address to go to school at Lincoln. After problems at Osborn and Denby. I learned more from Dave then all schools put together, including pershing on 7 and Ryan. True story. Along with Madison who lives in Orange County CA. PS. She has my two son's..</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rcXRopqipqSav7G%2BxK2YraGfo8Bvr86mZq%2BZnmK1orjEp2apmZ6WuqI%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

He said, adding,&nbsp;"Eric “Vietnam” Sadler production, that bomb squad shit, that's what i was groomed on, so I always come back to that."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The Brooklyn spitter also spoke of boom bap's recent resurgence, and expressed his confidence in the upcoming album. “Not only is [Boom Bap]&nbsp;being embraced, but it's that shit that is really creating the shift in the climate again, it's refreshing, it's inspiring, it's exciting. I personally feel that this is the best album I've ever made in my life."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Aside from his new projects, Busta shared the story of one of his very first solo hits "Put Your Hands Where My Eyes&nbsp;Can See", and how it&nbsp;contains a <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Diddy</a>&nbsp;impression.&nbsp;"That's how come I did the first calm voice record in my whole career. We were listening to some music and I had the beat, and I played the beat, they lost they mind over the beat. <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Diddy</a> and Tip was like, 'You need to calm down on these records because bitches don't want no "Rau Rau" witchu on every record. Chicks don't want to do that. You gotta do some shit that the chicks want to do,'" he recalled. "I wanted to make fun of Diddy on the song while I was doing my calm shit. That's why if you listen on the 'Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See' record, you hear, '97. Hot shit. Check it out.' All of that. 'Don't stop. Can't stop.' We was mocking Diddy."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Rhymes also shared thoughts on the current emcees he think will see the longevity that he has. “I would say <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Kendrick</a>, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Drake</a>, maybe <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">J.

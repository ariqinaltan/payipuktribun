They butchered him, sliced his ear, and cut through his head. I think it is the b*tt of the AK47 that they used to literally hit him on the head," she said.<p class=align-left>Zari, who is <a href=#>Diamond Platnumz's ex</a>, revealed that the thugs went to her bedroom and interrogated her family members while asking for the car keys.</p>"They got into the house, woke my family members up asking where is this, where is that, they managed to get away with actually quite a lot of things. That is not the issue. We are safe. My family members are safe, and the security hopefully heals. They even had the audacity to ask where are the keys to the cars. And I think on hearing the police coming, they ran off," she added.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/375c4c1e6533f6e2.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>"She kicked me": Canada-based Nigerian lady laments as her oyinbo landlady sends her packing</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Zari explained that she thought having security guards with guns would help, but because of the holiday season, people are targeted by thugs.</p>"There was a gun stolen; that is the property of the government; we are going to find you," she further said.<h2>Zari Hassan surprises son with sleek Mercedes Benz for his 20th birthday</h2><p class=align-left><strong>Legit.ng</strong> earlier reported that the Ugandan socialite <a href=# title>surprised her eldest son</a> Pinto with a new Mercedes Benz E-Class for his 20th <a href=#>birthday</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Zari Hassan took to her social media page to share a photo of her hunk son standing next to his new white whip.</p><p class=align-left>According to the mother of five, she made her son believe she was helping him find an office for his new business only to gift him the wrapped luxurious car.</p><p>Source: <a href=#>TUKO.co.ke</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI5qbHBoaGt9bsDInptmq5WYwrO107JkoK2Rp7FuwMeunqxlkqeyoreMrKacoZGhtrWxjLOYq6Fdna60v8Cnqmatl5a7pa3NZp%2BopZVk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

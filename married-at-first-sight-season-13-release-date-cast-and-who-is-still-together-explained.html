According to <a href=#>TV Insider</a>, a total of 12 couples from the show remain in wedded bliss to this day, including Jamie and Doug from all the way back in Season 1, who now have two children. Season 5 alums Anthony and Ashley are also still married and welcomed a daughter in 2019.</p><p dir=ltr>Another couple that made it were Jephte and Shawniece from Season 6, who had a daughter in 2018. From Season 7, Danielle and Bobby are still together and became a family of three when they welcomed their daughter in 2019. Season 8's Stephanie and AJ remain married despite AJ's temper. Also still together from that season are Kristine and Keith, who had to work through some issues. <a href=#>From Season 9</a>, couples Deonna and Gregory, and <a href=#>Elizabeth and Jamie</a>, are both still married, despite challenges of their own.</p><p dir=ltr>The later seasons seem to be more of a success. While only Jessica and Austin are still together from Season 10, Season 11 couples Bennett and Amelia, Amani and Woody, and Miles and Karen all remain married. As for the latest season, <a href=#>Ryan and Clara</a>, Briana and Vincent, and Virginia and Erik are all still together.

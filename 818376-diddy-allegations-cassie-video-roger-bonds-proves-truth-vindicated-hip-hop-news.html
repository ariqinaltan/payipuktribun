Moreover, the Bad Boy mogul's former bodyguard told Vlad of how he perceived the reaction to the video of Sean Combs assaulting <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Cassie</a> in a hotel hallway. Bonds told the story of how Puffy was intoxicated in this incident, and how many folks initially expressed skepticism at abuse claims that he and Cassie brought forth against Puff Daddy. However, Bonds also revealed how the release of the video also made him feel slightly vindicated, as the narrative they painted around their former colleague could no longer be denied, at least in part.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Of course, Diddy's multiple other lawsuits and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">accusations of sexual assault, abuse</a>, and sex trafficking aren't all immediately proven by a single video. What the clip did show us is that at least this specific incident occurred, regardless of how it paints other accusations. It's still very much a gray area, since there hasn't been a lot of explicit legal development when it comes to the search for accountability. Hopefully this changes soon with more details and investigations that get further to the truth behind all these accusations.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-roger-bonds-on-diddy-amp-cassie-video-validating-testimonies>Roger Bonds On Diddy & Cassie Video Validating Testimonies</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Still, recent changes and actions suggest that Diddy will take a public backseat for a while. For example, he and his team recently wiped his Instagram account's posts completely, one of which was a video apology to Cassie after this video leaked. The music executive and businessman's team relayed that <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">he still stands by the apology despite taking it down</a>. They also denied the idea that he took his posts down for any particular reason.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, others spent their time recently thinking of <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">ways in which Diddy could escape this public scrutiny</a>, including Michael Blackson. "There’s probably three ways [for him] coming back to life," he suggested. "Probably the&nbsp;Nation Of Islam. Number one, probably, right? You know, go out there, go talk to [Louis] Farrakhan, join the team. I mean put him on the street [to]&nbsp;sell bean pies, like they did back in [the] 90s. Two, just join the LGBTQIE [sic]. I’m not sure if I missed any letters or not. Join them […] Turn into a pastor [or] something;&nbsp;turn into a Ma$e. Y’know, become a pastor, or just pack this s**t and go to some village somewhere&nbsp;and change your name."</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop. He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdoZoV0g5Vmm6KclK56orjLnp6arJmku7R5wpqqrKGVYsOqsMSoZKunl5q%2Fbq7Op5usZaCnvLex0marq62knXq3tc2doJyZpJqxbrTIqWShp6Biu6bD0g%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

Hackman and the Hawaiian native first crossed paths when she held a part-time job at a Los Angeles fitness center, <a href=#>The New York Times Magazine</a> noted. Their relationship evolved quickly, with Arakawa moving into Hackman's Santa Fe home before his divorce was finalized. They tied the knot in 1991. By then, Hackman was already the legendary actor he'll always be remembered as, making the circumstances around his second marriage different.&nbsp;</p><p>When Hackman was married to Maltese, he knew letting parts go could hinder his career, and nothing mattered to him more than his professional success.&nbsp;"You spend so many years wanting desperately to be recognized as having the talent and then when you're starting to be offered these parts, it's very tough to turn anything down," he told The New York Times Magazine. He and Arakawa also have no children together, according to Closer Weekly.</p><p>Arakawa is a private person who avoids the spotlight, something she and Hackman have in common. Hackman and Arakawa have lived in relative reclusion in New Mexico since the 1980s, when the actor fell in love with the state's dramatic scenery, he told <a href=#>Architectural Digest</a> in 1990. After three decades together, Hackman and Arakawa are still going strong and enjoying the extra time they have together since <a href=#>Hackman retired from acting in 2004</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcG9hbIV1e9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2csq%2BxjKGYnKOdlru0edKemqimlGK6or7RopignV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

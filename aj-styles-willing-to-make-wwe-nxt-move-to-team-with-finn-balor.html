During a recent Twitch stream, the Phenomenal One was asked who he would like to team with in NXT. There are a lot of great choices, but he would like to align himself with another former leader of the Bullet Club."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Styles would love for that team to happen.</p><p>“You know, the only championship I haven’t held in WWE is the tag team championship. If I’m able to find a partner at some point, and win those, I will have won all the belts in WWE. [Finn would make a great partner] but he’s in NXT and I’m on SmackDown, so I don’t know how that would ever work. Listen, whether I have to go down to NXT or he has to come to SmackDown, I’m willing to do that. I mean, shoot, it would be fun, and different is good.”</p><p>It’s hard to imagine a team of AJ Styles and Finn Balor not being successful. WWE has a lot of combinations that they could make out of their roster. Balor and Styles would certainly make a team worth watching.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=#>Wrestling Inc</a> for the quote</p><span class=author-name>Felix Upton</span> <span></span><p>Felix Upton is a seasoned writer with over 30 years of experience.

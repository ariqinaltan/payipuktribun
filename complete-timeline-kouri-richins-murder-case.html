They had their first son together in 2012, and their wedding date was June 15, 2013. It should have been the happiest day in both of their lives, and photos from the wedding show both of them joyfully standing outside celebrating their love. They were married in their own backyard and it looked like a beautiful day, and for several years things appear to have gone on fine with the couple.</p><p dir=ltr>In Eric's&nbsp;obituary, it states that they had two more kids together during their nine-year marriage, and they were 9, 7, and 5 years old at the time of Eric's untimely death in 2022. Eric seems like he was the ultimate dad, coaching all of his sons' sports teams, and he was also big on outdoor activities like hunting and riding motorized vehicles. His nickname was Rico, and the couple lived in Francis, Utah, just outside of Park City.</p><p>Yet, while things may have seemed to be going well on the outside, at some point trouble started brewing. One of Eric's sisters alleged that Kouri may have tried to <a href=#>poison</a> him years prior to his death, but that's unsubstantiated (via The Washington Post). Either way, the relationship had broken down by 2022, right around the time Eric died — coincidentally or not.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9k2xtbmhjZLCwuc%2BlnK2dXam2rrHLoqWeZZukwrO1jKugnKCZo8BuudSrm56qXZiutLGO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

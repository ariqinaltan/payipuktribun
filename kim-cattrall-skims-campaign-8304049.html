She appeared in the season finale with a brief phone call with Sarah Jessica Parker's Carrie Bradshaw from across the pond. Despite it lasting just a mere 70 seconds and being filmed completely separate from any of her co-stars, the return of Samantha was certainly worth the wait.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57yqKkZpuRqcGzrculZKyjmaLAbq%2FApqeaoZejenl%2Fj21nbXE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

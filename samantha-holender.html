She's studied up on every ingredient you'll find on INCI list and is constantly in search of the world's glowiest makeup products. She's an expert in sensitive skin, acne, and aesthetics. Prior to joining the team, she worked as <a href=#>Us Weekly’s Beauty and Style Editor</a>, where she stayed on the pulse of pop culture and broke down celebrity beauty routines, hair transformations, and red carpet looks. Her words have also appeared on <a href=#>Popsugar,</a> <a href=#>Makeup.com</a>, <a href=#>Skincare.com</a>, Delish.com, and Philadelphia Wedding. Samantha also serves as a board member for the American Society of Magazine Editors (ASME).

Samantha has a degree in Journalism and Mass Communications from The George Washington University’s School of Media and Public Affairs. While at GWU, she was a founding member of the school’s HerCampus chapter and served as its President for four years. When she’s not deep in the beauty closet or swatching eyeshadows, you can find her obsessing over Real Housewives and all things Bravo.

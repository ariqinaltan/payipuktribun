Opposite those is a kingsize bed with a large mirror hanging on the wall above it. There's a grey, faux fur rug on one side of the bedroom floor and little brown baskets dotted around the room to use for storage. There's also a stunning bay window in a mahogany wood which looks out onto the garden.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/604d5ccf073f-victoria-beckham-childhood-bedroom2-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=etXjm9tKpolL data-wc=8><strong>A kingsize bed sits under an ornate mirror</strong></p><p id=e7IGPBiHHuwk data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>The Beckham's Cotswolds home is even more amazing than you'd ever imagine</a></strong></p><p id=e2bV355Rx86R data-wc=52>Explaining her surroundings, Victoria said in the clips: "So today me, David and the kids came to visit my mum and dad and this is my old bedroom – it brings back so many memories.

So this is Aunt Sally and this is Worzel Gummidge, and I remember my mum and dad giving these to me and my sister one Christmas when we were really young. It brings back such nice memories it really does. It’s so nice to come back."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/771faa322451-victoria-beckham-childhood-bedroom3-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eDXMJwL6MAAh data-wc=10><strong>Two huge windows sit on opposite sides of the room</strong></p><p id=esAYh72ai-nl data-wc=86>We can certainly see who may have inspired Victoria's own <a class=hm-link href=#>decorating tastes in her £31million London home</a>. She and husband David spent an estimated £8million on renovation work in 2016, and are understandably proud of their abode. Beautifully decorated throughout, it boasts its own gym, wine cellar and even separate quarters for their eldest son Brooklyn to live in for his own privacy. The family also have a second home to spend time in, a barn conversion in the Cotswolds where they are currently isolating amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The Writers Guild last week <a href=#>voted to end the strike</a> while the deal was being ratified.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Meanwhile, SAG-AFTRA is still on strike but <a href=#>resumed negotiations with the AMPTP on Monday</a>, with the two sides expected to talk again on Wednesday.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Due to the writers strike ending, Cooper’s co-writer Josh Singer, who skipped the Venice world premiere for Maestro, was able to attend the NY Film Festival event and spoke with media outlets on the red carpet and participated in a post-screening Q&A.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Speaking to THR about the end of the writers strike prior to Monday’s screening, Singer said he was grateful to the WGA negotiators “who I think worked very hard and bravely fought to put in protections for writers for many years to come.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">He added, “And I’m also grateful that it’s over, and I get to stand here today and talk about a movie I’ve been working on for nine years.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Singer added that he was hopeful for a speedy resolution to the actors strike.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I know there are different issues [with the actors than with the WGA], but I’m hopeful just so the town can get working again,” he said. “But I think actors need to get the protections they want.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">When asked he and his fellow producers felt about debuting Maestro amid the ongoing actors strike, producer Fred Berner indicated he was hopeful a resolution would be coming soon.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I’m just sad I can’t hug all of these folks and celebrate,” he said. “We will hopefully have an opportunity. I’m starting to think it’s beginning to thaw a little bit.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">He added, “I think it’s worse for [the actors] than it is for us. How can you put all of that time and energy and love into something and not be able to stand there and get a smidgen of it back?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKO%2BwJ2jnrFdmLywvMSrZJqspJq7pb%2BMppieq6SnvG680Z6kop2imnpzfJFsZKexXZu2rbmMn5ysrJmrrq15kGtqbm5gbH12gY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

As Iglesias told <a href=#>People</a>, he "went into survival mode" as the stress of balancing work and family began taking its toll. Iglesias faced burnout and <a href=#>alcoholism</a> in tandem, and during his set in Dallas, the comedian broke down on stage while talking about his son.</p><p>"I got emotional on stage talking about the fact that my son is no longer a kid. Now he's an adult, he's a man. And it hit me where I got choked up, I walked off stage, and I just I buckled," Iglesias told <a href=#>Billboard</a>&nbsp;in 2018. "I fell down and was like, 'Oh my God, what am I doing with myself?' Yeah there's cars, yeah there's money, but am I still happy? I got a kid at home who has everything, but didn't have me around as much as he could've had." Iglesias sat down with his son Frankie and apologized for all the "years of me being away."</p><p>Frankie forgave Iglesias, and the "Fluffy" comedian took time off from comedy to recover and reflect on what matters most. Now, however, as Iglesias waits to get back on the road with his tour, he told <a href=#>People</a> that "home is different for me now" that he's single because he "can focus on myself, my career, my kid and my dogs."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2phZ310e9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2crqO%2ByJ6jZqGXobK0tcCsZKaxo6mys7XOrqpmpJ%2Brsm64yJ%2BcaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

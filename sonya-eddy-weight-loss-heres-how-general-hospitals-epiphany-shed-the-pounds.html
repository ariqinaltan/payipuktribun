It had been quite some time since Eddy’s character was last seen at the hospital, so viewers were amazed to see her incredible transformation.
But she was right back being her sassy self when she injected herself into the conversation that Finn (Michael Easton) and Anna (Finola Hughes) were having — and everyone knows, what Epiphany says goes!"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I put my four little dogs in the basket and go!”</p><p>She realized that she didn’t feel healthy last year and that helped to jumpstart the process of losing weight and doing more for herself. Small changes like putting all of the groceries away right after shopping has helped Sonya Eddy tremendously.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by General Hospital (@generalhospitalabc)</a></p><h2>How much weight did she lose?</h2><p>When Sonya Eddy spoke about her weight loss back at the start of October, she had already lost 60lbs this year. Filming for General Hospital happens weeks in advance, so possibly around a similar time as the interview took place.</p><p>However, nearly two months have passed since then, so she could well have lost more since then. Her most recent post on Instagram, taken five days ago at the time of writing, shows her looking amazing.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Sonya Eddy (@sonyaeddy)</a></p><p>Epiphany Johnson has been a fan favorite on General Hospital for many years. She always shows up for the Nurses Ball in May (when it is actually held) and her singing voice is usually highlighted.

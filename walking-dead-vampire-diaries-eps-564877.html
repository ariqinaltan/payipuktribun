Following news Friday that Richardson was arrested and charged with mailing a threatening communication to the president of the United States, the executive producers behind a pair of shows the suspect apparently appeared on have one question: who?
Multiple outlets, including The Hollywood Reporter, ran stories identifying Richardson as a Walking Dead actress who also appeared on The Vampire Diaries."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

And it’s a similar case on The CW’s The Vampire Diaries.</p><p>The wave of headlines led former Walking Dead writer/executive producer Glen Mazzara and Vampire Diaries showrunner Julie Plec to take notice.</p><p>“Some actress from TWD sent ricin letters to the Prez? Never heard of her.

Or something.” Earlier, she <a href=# rel=nofollow>tweeted</a>: “My mom called me today very concerned about my affiliation w ricin terrorists. She’s not hip to the term click-bait. Nor was I until today.”</p><p>The 35-year-old Richardson was arrested in Mt. Pleasant, Texas, on Friday and appeared in front of Judge&nbsp;<strong>Caroline Craven</strong>&nbsp;on Friday afternoon in Texarkana, Texas, for an initial appearance. She was charged with mailing a threatening communication to the president of the United States. If convicted, Richardson faces up to 10 years in federal prison.</p><p>Richardson&nbsp;— also known as Shannon Rogers and Shannon Guess — has an IMDb page under the latter name with several photos and a handful of videos — yet no official credits.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOsJilo5mjtG6wxJqbZq6Ror2qvsRmm6KZop6ytHnEqapmbWZphXiDjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

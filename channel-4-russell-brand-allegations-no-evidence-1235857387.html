The program also spoke of controlling, abusive and predatory behavior by the star, who has vehemently denied wrongdoing.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The Channel 4 report unveiled Tuesday also addressed whether senior network execs were aware of allegations against Brand when the Dispatches program was being researched and produced after going into development in Dec. 2019.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“While the investigation found that the recollections of former and current Channel 4 staff interviewed varied about when concerns around Russell Brand started to circulate within the commissioning team, the investigating team found no written or corroborated evidence to show that suspicions of serious allegations about Russell Brand’s behavior were held within the channel before the special was broadcast,” the report stated.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“No record was found of concerns being raised within Channel 4, or in public, at the time of Russell Brand’s casting in the Celebrity Bake Off Stand Up to Cancer special or after its broadcast in March 2019,” the British network added in its report.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">At the same time, Channel 4 disclosed a former network employee “made a serious and concerning allegation about Russell Brand in 2009” that was not brought to the attention of senior management “nor investigated as it should have been,” Alex Mahon, CEO of Channel 4, said in a statement. The Channel 4 boss has since apologized to the individual.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOnJ%2Bapp6auW6AjKusrKuVoblurtGapZ1lkaG5prPAraCopqNiu7B5xK%2BgnZ2emLJufZFsbHFtZ2iFeHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

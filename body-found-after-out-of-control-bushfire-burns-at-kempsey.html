It is always done with the safety and wellbeing of our staff and students in mind,” a Department of Education spokesperson said.</p><p>“It is important for parents and carers to know that schools do not offer minimal supervision when schools are temporarily closed due to bushfire threat.”<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7zZqroqeelrlwutKwZJqbpGS7psPSaJmonKlis7DBzZ1kmp6kmr9uu9StZKieXZi8r8DRqKNmmqWotae10Z5km62io8BurdNmop6loKiyunvNnq6sZaOpvLPFjnBun2tkmK6nfpWeaHBuZpiFc63DbG9ybWKXgnGtxW9w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

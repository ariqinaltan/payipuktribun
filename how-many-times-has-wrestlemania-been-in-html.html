heart.</span><span> But just how many times has WrestleMania turned Hollywood?</span><span> Let's grab some popcorn,</span><span> crank up the entrance themes,</span><span> and dive into the squared circle!</span></p><span></span><p data-sourcepos=5:1-5:46><strong>From the 80s Mullet to the 2020s Bodyslam: A Chronological Journey</strong></p><span></span><p data-sourcepos=7:1-7:378><span>We gotta start at the beginning,</span><span> folks.</span><span> Buckle up for a trip down memory lane (with neon leg warmers optional).</span><span> WrestleMania wasn't always the two-night extravaganza it is today.</span><span> Back in the day,</span><span> it was a one-night spectacle,</span><span> and in </span><strong>1986 (WrestleMania 2, to be exact)</strong><span>,</span><span> Los Angeles played host for the first time.</span><span> Think Hulk Hogan's heyday,</span><span> King Kong Bundy in a cage match (because,</span><span> why not?</span><span>),</span><span> and a whole lotta spandex.</span></p><span></span><p data-sourcepos=9:1-9:446><strong>WrestleMania VII</strong><span> followed in </span><strong>1987</strong><span>,</span><span> originally planned for the vast Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.</span><span> However,</span><span> a twist worthy of a Vince McMahon storyline:</span><span> ticket sales were a bit sluggish.</span><span> So,</span><span> they switched things up and moved the whole shebang to the indoor Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena.</span><span> Still a legendary night,</span><span> though,</span><span> featuring the unforgettable "Macho Man" Randy Savage and Miss Elizabeth reuniting in the ring.</span><span> Cue the waterworks!</span></p><span></span><p data-sourcepos=11:1-11:393><strong>Fast forward to the 90s</strong><span> (when wrestling gear went from big hair to big muscles) and WrestleMania returned to Los Angeles for </span><strong>WrestleMania XII</strong><span> in </span><strong>1996</strong><span>.</span><span> This one's etched in the WWE history books for the epic Iron Man Match between Shawn Michaels and Bret "The Hitman" Hart.</span><span> A true donnybrook that'll have you on the edge of your seat (or folding chair,</span><span> if you're feeling nostalgic).</span></p><span></span><p data-sourcepos=13:1-13:70><strong>The New Millennium</strong><span> brought a new WrestleMania to L.</span><span>A.</span><span> in </span><strong>2000</strong><span>.</span><span> This time,</span><span> the Staples Center (RIP!</span><span>) was the battleground.</span><span> We saw Triple H conquer The Rock in a six-man Hell in a Cell match,</span><span> a brutal but unforgettable encounter.</span><span> WrestleMania 21 in </span><strong>2005</strong><span> gave us another dose of Los Angeles magic.</span><span> John Cena and Batista were on the rise,</span><span> and who can forget the legendary Eddie Guerrero's emotional championship win?</span><span> Tears,</span><span> cheers,</span><span> and enough body slams to make your head spin.</span></p><span></span><p data-sourcepos=15:1-15:232><strong>And then, WrestleMania returned to L.A. in all its glory in 2023 (WrestleMania 39, for those keeping track).</strong><span> SoFi Stadium hosted the epic two-night event,</span><span> with The Miz and Snoop Dogg (talk about an unlikely duo!</span><span>) as co-hosts.</span></p><span></span><p data-sourcepos=17:1-17:125><strong>So, the big reveal?</strong><span> Los Angeles has been graced with the presence of WrestleMania a whopping </span><strong>six times</strong><span>.</span><span> That's right,</span><span> folks,</span><span> the City of Angels is a bonafide wrestling hotspot.</span></p><span></span><p data-sourcepos=19:1-19:315><strong>Will WrestleMania return to L.A. again?</strong><span> Knowing the WWE's penchant for big surprises,</span><span> we wouldn't bet against it.</span><span> Just imagine the spectacle!</span><span> Maybe they'll even have a celebrity Royal Rumble on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</span><span> The possibilities are endless,</span><span> and that's what keeps the magic of WrestleMania alive.</span></p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWrGWtnZOdfHN8kW1maW1fnby4ecyapbJlpJ66pr%2BMoZisZaensrTAy56kmqaZlnqjscSnZKKmXp3Brrg%3D</p><footer

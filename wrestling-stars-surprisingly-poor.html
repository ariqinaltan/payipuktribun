He was in such poor health that it took another wrestler, Diamond Dallas Page, putting together an <a href=# data-darkreader-inline-color>Indiegogo campaign</a> to help save Hall's life. At 54, Hall already had a pacemaker and his body seemed broken. Arthritis had left him immobilized and he desperately needed a hip replacement he couldn't afford with no medical insurance. Luckily, Page's campaign worked amazingly well, and he was able to raise well over $100,000.</p><p>With Page's help, Hall turned a corner and now looks to be in <a href=# data-darkreader-inline-color>good enough shape</a>, according to Fox Sports, to try his hand at rebooting some of his career, maybe getting back some of what he lost.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kWlrcG5frL%2Bmv9OloKefXajBor7SZqquqqCntrS1zaCjsmWgpLyzew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

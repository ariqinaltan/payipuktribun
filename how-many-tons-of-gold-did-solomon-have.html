Some of the treasures were hidden in Israel and Babylonia, while others were delivered into the hands of the angels Shamshiel, Michael and Gabriel.<h2>How much gold was used in the Tabernacle?</h2>The offering of gold by the Israelites for the construction of the tabernacle is accompanied by a ritual of תנופה, a process involving elevating and brandishing the offering before YHWH: “The gold swung and brandished (זהב התנופה) was twenty-nine talents and 730 shekels, by the shekel of the sanctuary” (Exod 38:24b ESV ...<h2>Was Solomon's temple covered in gold?</h2>According to the Bible, the temple was built from masterfully quarried stone blocks, with a roof and interior lined with lavish wood planks.

She returned to her kingdom, where she bore Solomon a son, Menilek.<h2>How much is a talent of gold?</h2>The gold talent is reported as weighing roughly the same as a person, and so perhaps 50 kg (>110 lb avoirdupois). Some authorities say that the talent typically weighed about 33 kg (>72 lb) varying from 20 to 40 kg. In June, 2018, the international price of gold was about US $41,155.69 per kilogram.<h2>How was King Solomon so rich?</h2>King Solomon was made rich through commerce, trading, gifts he received, tribute money paid to him and heavy taxation.

To do so, he launched a “donation drive” that netted 5,000 gold and 10,000 silver talents (roughly $100 million in today's currency).<h2>What color was Queen Sheba?</h2>So when was the first time she was described as Black?

But Smollett-Bell says it wasn’t as appropriate as it seems.</p><p>“You can hear the running water, the water heater coming on, my nephew’s upstairs, he’s a baby so he was crying, you can hear the chairs being dragged,” she says with a laugh. “So not professional.”</p><p><strong><a href=#>STORY: ‘True Blood’ Season Six Premiere Date Announced</a></strong></p><p>The tape was enough to get her the part as a series regular. Smollett-Bell will make her first appearance in the second episode of season six.</p><p>The HBO drama is infamous for its sexy scenes and has never been afraid to show plenty of nudity, but Smollett-Bell says that didn’t affect her decision to join the show.</p><p>“One thing they do well is it’s not gratuitous and it’s not exploitive. It’s not just for the sake of it,” she says. “I think through the arc of my character, you’ll see what’s appropriate and what’s not appropriate, but it’s all coming back to the plot of my character.”</p><p>True Blood returns for season six on Sunday, June 16, at 9 p.m. on HBO.</p><p>Email: Rebecca.Ford@thr.com; Twitter:<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> @Beccamford</a></p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOramunV2XubC7w2ahrqqemrJuv8yoo6WdpKl6o7HLpWRta2JpfXd7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

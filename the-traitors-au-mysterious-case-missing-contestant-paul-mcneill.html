I’ve never seen an edit like it. He was almost removed from the entire show. No back story shown, no exit interview in the car, mic muted on a few occasions, I think he said five sentences in ten episodes?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e5315eaa57c5-437171.jpg><p id=eOvynM73ZDX data-wc=46>The editing is truly bizarre when watching the show, with the action often cutting away from Paul, or only showing him when one of his comments is essential to viewers. His scenes were even cut short during the Banishment votes – so what on earth happened?</p><p id=eg05lwo3ag9 data-wc=36>Since there has been no official word about the situation (HELLO! has reached out to the show's production company for comment), we can only go on what we have learned from Paul himself, and other contestants.</p><p id=eXhr-AhoTLi data-wc=43>Replying to a fan wondering why Paul was cut out of the show, Dirk Strachan-Thornton replied: "He definitely wasn't boring. But he talked a lot about production and it couldn't be included in final edits. So they didn't have a lot from him."</p><p id=e5fLra034mt data-wc=72>Paul also spoke about the situation on The Traidar: A Traitor's Podcast, saying: "I think maybe because – look, I was the oldest, and these shows if you look at the statistics of people watching it, it's young people… but it was a little bit off. Just watched the episodes again, the camera just moves away all the time. I've yet to see my backstory as well! It's a really good backstory!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ebbc92d029db-437206.jpg><p id=egP9sBVOCC3 data-wc=71>He continued: "We're all being interviewed, we're all being asked the questions… I spoke to [Chloe] when we met for drinks. As well as challenges, we'd have little get-togethers, chopping wood and playing pool. I was paired with Chloe to play backgammon… we're talking and she goes, 'Hold on a minute. There's someone in the room,' and I said, 'Yeah, the cameraman!'" Uh oh, a little mention about the production there!</p><p id=e5E0up1fMj1K data-wc=73>He continued: "Every single one of [my fellow contestants] wondered why. I got loads of emails. In these shows you've got the loud, the gregarious, and they concentrate on them… if you go deep, you don't have too much at the beginning. But as it went along, 'I was like, well I always wanted to go on a gameshow or a quiz show, and I still want to go on a reality show!'"&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5tcHFuaGl8tbTEZqurmZmpvLO%2FjJqsZqWpqMGmvsiorKxlk5bApnnMoqqsoZ6ceqS7za2crKyRo8FuvMCuo2alk6OyqrjLaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

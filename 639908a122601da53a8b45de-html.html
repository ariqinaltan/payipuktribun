When he was first diagnosed with this disease, the actor's entire family issued a statement on their social media about the situation. Some might've found it strange that his wife and ex wife were both part of that joint statement. <strong>Willis </strong>has always valued family over everything else and he always promoted family unity like the one he shows in this recent picture. Ex wife <strong>Demi Moore</strong> kept a close relationship with Willis even after the divorce.</p><p>As they co-parented their daughters, Bruce found love again in Emma and had more children. Today, the entire family get together for the holidays and celebrate while they still have Bruce alongside them. It was <strong>Demi Moore</strong> herself who shared this image of her with Willis, <strong>Emma</strong>, and all of the actor's daughters. Their names are <strong>Rumer, 34, Scout, 31, Tallulah, 28, Mabel Ray, 10, and Evelyn Penn, 8</strong>. All of them together in a beautiful blended family portrait. Bruce was right in the middle with a big smile on him.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Demi Moore shared a small Bruce Willis photo album</h2><p>But that wasn't the only snap shared by <strong>Demi Moore</strong> on her official Instagram account, she share a small album. Even though this was shared by Moore on Tuesday, previous photos shared by <strong>Tallulah </strong>on December 7 prove this gathering took place a few days before the album was shared. With the aphasia diagnosis, the entire Willis family needs to give <strong>Bruce </strong>all the love and attention he can get. Time will take some motor skills away from him and he might no longer be able to enjoy family time as he does right now.</p><p>Despite he already retired from acting, <strong>Bruce Willis</strong> is still appearing in films that go directly to streaming because of how much he worked before getting that diagnosis. He was paid for all of those roles he still plays but people need to be aware he is fully retired now. Enjoying family time is all <strong>Willis </strong>needs to do right now. Acting is behind him, let the man enjoy his life as a <strong><a href=#>retiree</a></strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqWgn52jqcatsY6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGZraGJnfHJ%2BjmpraG5jboZxhMBqaWtuYGaxooGSmm%2BbbGWZsm%2B006aj</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

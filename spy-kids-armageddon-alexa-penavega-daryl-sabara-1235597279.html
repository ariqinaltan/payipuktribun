The filmmaker spoke about his decision to launch the latest Spy Kids chapter with a completely new family — and new set of leading child stars — in a new interview with Yahoo Entertainment."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Alba portrayed an Organization of Super&nbsp;Spies agent who was married to McHale’s spy-hunting reporter. Vega and Sabara were the niece and nephew of Alba’s secret agent, whose stepchildren (Blanchard and Cook) face off against a villain who threatens to unleash a time weapon known as Project: Armageddon.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">While the director, also known for The Book of Boba Fett, Grindhouse and From Dusk Till Dawn, is interested in expanding the Spy Kids universe with a new family, it doesn’t mean he hasn’t considered bringing back his former leads.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I would love to bring back [characters], I would love to connect the worlds. That would be so fun,” he said. “It could still be in the same world, so if we get to make more films, there easily could be legacy characters that come back.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">During the interview, Rodriguez also shared the significance of being able to release another Spy Kids sequel in Hollywood’s current storytelling climate. “It’s hard to make movies in Hollywood that aren’t [based on] a preexisting material that a studio owns,” he said. “So when you can come up with your own story and make sequels to it, man, you’re going to make as many of those as you can because it’s a rarity.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Released in 2001, the original Spy Kids starred Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino as two spies who, after being kidnapped, must be saved by their two children, played by PenaVega and Sabara. Since then, four more films have been released, including Armageddon and an animated series, Spy Kids: Mission Critical.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofLS82GaiopyjYq6zucCgnJ2cn6N6orjEsZhmqJWjrrexxppknZmirrluv8CbmKuZXWZ%2FdIGUcm5rb2lk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

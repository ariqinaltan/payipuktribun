This differs from traditional fasting or “clean” fasting, which restricts all foods and calorie-containing beverages. People who practice dirty fasting will typically consume up to 100 calories during their fasting window.<h2>Why am I gaining weight while fasting?</h2>The people who are fasting always feel that they will lose weight, but the fact is different.

Cole</a> recently surprised up-and-coming rapper Ty Trilly at his listening session in a New York City project, and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">lended an ear</a> to his track "<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Adapt</a>." Moreover, it's unclear how they linked, but Ty expressed his gratitude via Instagram with a clip of Cole. "Cole pulled up on me To hear my new shit, No Meetings in the city straight Raw block shit,” he wrote. “Appreciate You @realcoleworld , It’s up From Here !!" Then, the Dreamville boss gave Trilly some advice on the song.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I ain’t even put a second verse on it yet,” Ty told him, to which Cole replied earnestly. “You don’t even need it, n***a. Shoot the s**t, put that b***h out, next! ‘<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Cause they gon’ feel it</a>. And they gon’ feel the next one, I swear to God. I know what you mean like, ‘Man, I probably need a second verse.’ No, n***a. Just that! Shoot the video, put that b***h out, it’s gon’ land on the people it’s supposed to land on."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-j-cole-at-burgeoning-nyc-rapper-s-listening-session>J. Cole At Burgeoning NYC Rapper's Listening Session</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Recently, J. Cole apparently found a type beat from YouTube he liked and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">dropped a song exclusively on the creator's channel</a>. Even though <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">not everybody believes that story</a>, it's certainly consistent with this clip- that is, if this is a genuine run-in, as well. But when has skepticism ever been fun in the rap game? Regardless, the "No Role Modelz" rapper, and role model for many, also talked to Trilly's crew about how to take off.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I’m shooting that s**t, I’ma go with my n***a — what is it? Pasta on the what? Pasta On Da Lenz. And I’m taking it to the crib, we gon’ edit this s**t and I’m putting it out, bro! Y’all n***as got a whole f***ing — it’s already a network over here. You n***as just gotta come together, you know what I mean? There’s too many people right here to not have the network." From <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">one of the best rappers of our generation</a>, those words should mean a lot to an MC of any background or exposure level. Regardless, check out more clips of their interaction down below, and return to HNHH for the latest on J. Cole.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-ty-trilly-s-crew-gets-game>Ty Trilly's Crew Gets Game</h2></span><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop. He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdman14hZRmoWabn6GybrPRmpqeq12WwLG10aKloGWilr2xsdFmrqKsmGK5qr%2FTnqWippdiwKa%2F0qKmp2WmnsCqwIyipWamqZh6sb7Oo5ycrKM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
